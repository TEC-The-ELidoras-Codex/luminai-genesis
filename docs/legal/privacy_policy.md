This Privacy Policy explains how The Elidoras Codex ("we", "us", or "LuminAI") collects, uses, discloses and protects personal information in connection with our software repository, websites, and services ("Services").

1. Information We Collect
- Information you provide directly: when you subscribe to updates, contact us, or participate in a pilot program, we may collect your name, email, organization and related details.
- Usage data: we may collect technical logs and metrics about how you access our Services (IP addresses, browser/user agent, request logs) for security, analytics and troubleshooting.
- Service data: in research/clinical settings and pilot programs, we may collect event data or messages you provide. Where applicable, collection occurs only after informed consent.

2. How We Use Information
- Provide and maintain the Services.
- Communicate with you about updates, support, and pilots.
- Improve our product and analyze usage patterns.
- Comply with legal obligations and protect our community.

3. Data Sharing
- We do not sell personal information. We may share aggregated, anonymized usage data publicly for research and transparency.
- We may use third-party service providers (hosting, analytics) that process data only to provide services on our behalf and under confidentiality terms.
- For research exports, personal data will be de-identified unless you have explicitly provided consent for identifiable data to be used.

4. Data Retention
- We retain data for as long as necessary to provide the Services, comply with legal obligations, and maintain security. If you request deletion, we will take reasonable steps to remove your data.

5. Security
- We implement administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect personal data. No system is perfectly secure; if a breach occurs, we will follow legal notification obligations.

6. Your Rights
- Request access, correction, deletion, or portability of your personal data by contacting us (see contact info below).
- You can opt-out of marketing communications at any time.

7. International Transfers
