# Legal Identity

Official legal filing address and identity guidance for the project.

- Public-facing identity, outreach, manifestos, and lore: **Buffalo, NY**
- Official/legal filings, mailing address for forms and registrations: **West Seneca, NY 14224**

Where specific legal templates require a street address, use the address documented in the `docs/legal` files (e.g., `542 Birchwood Square, Apt. 8, West Seneca, New York 14224`).

If you need a different format for a filing (state form, IRS, etc.), consult `docs/legal/*` for the canonical template to copy.
