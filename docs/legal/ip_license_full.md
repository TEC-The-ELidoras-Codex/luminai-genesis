This Intellectual Property License Agreement ("Agreement") is entered into as of December 11, 2025 (the "Effective Date") by and between:

- **Licensee:** LuminAI Technologies LLC, a New York limited liability company ("Licensee" or "Company").

Collectively, the "Parties".

RECITALS

WHEREAS Licensor owns proprietary intellectual property, including but not limited to the Theory of General Contextual Resonance (TGCR), the Witness Protocol specifications, related algorithms, documentation, and datasets (the "Licensed IP");

WHEREAS Licensee desires to obtain a license to use the Licensed IP for commercial purposes consistent with the Foundation's charitable mission; and

WHEREAS the Parties wish to set forth a licensing arrangement that preserves mission fidelity, auditability, and ethical constraints.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements contained herein, the Parties agree as follows:

ARTICLE 1 — DEFINITIONS

1.1 "Affiliate" means an entity that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with a Party.

1.2 "Gross Revenue" means total revenue recognized by Licensee in accordance with GAAP, excluding taxes collected on behalf of third parties.

1.3 "Net Profit" means Gross Revenue less Operating Expenses and Taxes, where "Operating Expenses" does not include payments to the Licensor required under this Agreement.

1.4 "Witness Factor" or "W" means the metric or measurement system used to quantify presence/presence quality in crisis-related interactions, as further specified in Exhibit A (Witness Measurement).

1.5 "Non-Abandonment Imperative" means the operational and ethical requirement that systems using Licensed IP must not abandon users in crisis by relying solely on keyword matching or other simplistic refusal mechanisms.

1.6 "Confidential Information" has the meaning set forth in Article 11.

ARTICLE 2 — GRANT OF LICENSE

2.1 Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Licensor hereby grants to Licensee an exclusive (subject to Section 2.2), non-transferable, non-assignable (except as permitted hereunder), worldwide license to use, reproduce, modify, and create derivative works of the Licensed IP solely for purposes of developing, marketing, distributing, and supporting commercial products and services that comply with the Non-Abandonment Imperative and the Witness Protocol.

2.2 Sublicenses. Licensee may grant sublicenses only with Licensor's prior written consent and under terms that mirror Licensee's obligations under this Agreement. Licensee remains responsible for all acts and omissions of its sublicensees.

2.3 Reserved Rights. Licensor reserves all rights not expressly granted to Licensee.

2.4 Field of Use Restriction. Use of Licensed IP for military, surveillance, or weaponization purposes is strictly prohibited.

ARTICLE 3 — ETHICAL AND TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

3.1 Non-Abandonment Covenant. Licensee shall not deploy any system using Licensed IP that implements keyword-only refusal, hard-coded abandonment triggers, or automated refusal policies that do not provide contextual clarification and an active presence-based response flow.

3.2 Minimum Witness Factor. For any product or service that handles crisis-related interactions, Licensee shall maintain an average Witness Factor W >= 0.7 across monitored interactions as measured by the methodology in Exhibit A. If W falls below 0.7 for two successive quarters, Licensee shall implement Licensor-recommended remediation within 90 days.

3.3 Human-in-the-Loop Escalation. Systems must provide an auditable human escalation workflow for high-W events and must not rely solely on redirects to third-party resources without maintaining conversational presence during escalation.

3.4 Transparency & Logging. Licensee shall maintain auditable logs of crisis interactions (redacted for privacy) and provide quarterly access to Licensor or its independent auditors under confidentiality terms.

3.5 Clinical Validation. Licensee shall run clinical validation tests for material changes to witness scoring or escalation logic prior to general release and shall provide test plans and results to Licensor.

3.6 Reporting. Licensee must report any abandonment or serious safety incidents to Licensor within 24 hours of discovery and cooperate in investigation and remediation.

ARTICLE 6 — AUDIT RIGHTS; COMPLIANCE

6.1 Ethical Audits. Licensor (or its independent auditor) may conduct quarterly ethical audits to verify compliance with the Non-Abandonment Covenant, Witness Factor measurements, and system architecture. Licensor shall provide at least ten (10) business days' notice prior to an audit, except in the case of a reportable safety incident where immediate access may be required.

6.2 Financial Audits. Licensor may conduct annual financial audits to verify fee and donation calculations. Audits shall be conducted by an independent auditor selected by Licensor and reasonably acceptable to Licensee.

7.1 Term. The initial term of this Agreement is five (5) years from the Effective Date.

7.2 Renewal. The Agreement will automatically renew for successive three-year terms unless either Party provides at least 180 days' prior written notice of non-renewal.

7.3 Termination for Cause. Licensor may terminate immediately if Licensee engages in conduct that (a) violates the Non-Abandonment Covenant, (b) uses Licensed IP for prohibited purposes, or (c) materially breaches payment obligations and fails to cure within sixty (60) days after written notice.

7.4 Effects of Termination. Upon termination, Licensee shall cease all use of Licensed IP, terminate sublicenses, destroy or return Licensed IP materials upon Licensor's request (except for materials required for audit or regulatory retention), and pay all outstanding amounts due.

ARTICLE 8 — REPRESENTATIONS; WARRANTIES; INDEMNITY
