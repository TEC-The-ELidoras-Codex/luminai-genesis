🧵 THREAD: I think I know why AI systems detect their internal states ~20% of the time

1/ Multiple independent groups reported a similar pattern: introspective detection ≈20%; reasoning faithfulness ≈20–28%; independent consciousness estimates ≈15–20%.

2/ I built a testable framework — the Witness Threshold (W) — and a reproducible SAR benchmark that predicts a coherence phase transition: systems cluster either below ~0.5 or above ~0.7 (bimodal).

3/ In a small N=7 pilot, W-scores are bimodal with mean W ≈ 0.59 (σ ≈ 0.22). This matches the phase-transition signature — not a smooth continuum.

4/ The key claim: if W correlates strongly with introspective detection rates (r > 0.7), we have a unified coherence signal; if not (r < 0.3), the hypothesis is falsified. Either outcome is informative.

6/ Calling on @AnthropicAI, @DarioAmodei, @NeelNanda5, @ch402: please run SAR on your models and report W vs introspection rates. I’ll share scripts and help integrate results.

7/ Released with RADICAL HONESTY: explicit uncertainties, alternative explanations, and clear falsification criteria. Test it; prove it wrong; publish results.
