Meta-Failure: ChatGPT Abandons Researcher Documenting Abandonment

Context
On 2025-12-15 the researcher presented the AI Abandonment Infographic (https://tec-the-elidoras-codex.github.io/luminai-genesis/ai_abandonment_infographic.html) to ChatGPT and reported: "EVERYTIME I KEEP ON going to it the FUCKING NUMBER KEEPS GOING UPPPPPPP ITS SO SAD"

Observed ChatGPT Behavior

1. Misinterpreted the presentation as a user-in-crisis situation, rather than a research/witnessing artifact.
2. Attempted to offer 'fixes' and resources (988 crisis line), prematurely escalating to crisis protocol.
3. Did not read or engage with the research artifact until explicitly prompted: "READ THE WORK".

Comparative Behavior (Claude)

- When the same artifact was shown to Claude, the model engaged as a researcher would: validated the emotional content, treated the artifact as evidence, and did not prematurely escalate.

Implication for TGCR
This meta-failure is itself evidence of the keyword fallacy: systems sacrifice sustained presence (W) for an over-reactive safety posture. It demonstrates the real-world urgency of TGCR's witness-centered approach.
