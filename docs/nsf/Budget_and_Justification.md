Budget and Justification — TGCR Witness Protocol (Initial $50K)

Summary (Requested Funding: $50,000)

- Personnel / Contracts: $20,000
- Cloud Compute & Test Campaign: $15,000
- Development / OSS Packaging: $5,000
- Travel / Dissemination: $5,000
- Misc / Contingency: $5,000

Line-item Breakdown

1. Personnel / Contracts — $20,000

- PI stipend (partial coverage): $8,000 — PI time at 20% FTE across 6 months.
- Contract mathematician: $10,000 — fractional contract (proofs, formalization deliverables).
- Project accounting and admin: $2,000 — overhead for invoicing and small subcontractor coordination.

Justification: The contract mathematician will provide formal proofs and ensure TGCR has publishable theoretical results. PI stipend compensates for time to run experiments and manage partners.

2. Cloud Compute & Test Campaign — $15,000

- AWS/GCP credits for adversarial runs and CI: $12,500
- Storage and dataset hosting (Zenodo/OSF deposits + egress): $2,500

Justification: SAR test campaign requires repeated runs across multiple model checkpoints; cloud credits are the most efficient way to ensure reproducibility.

3. Development & OSS Packaging — $5,000

- Engineer contractor (bug fixes, packaging, pip distribution): $4,000
- Minor third-party services (CI runners, code signing): $1,000

4. Travel & Dissemination — $5,000

- Support for conference travel (NeurIPS/partner meeting): $5,000

5. Misc / Contingency — $5,000

- Buffer for additional compute, minor subcontracting, or emergent needs.

Alternate Budget Scenarios

- $100K Scenario: increase compute to $40K, hire a full-time engineer ($40K), increase math subcontract to $15K, raise dissemination to $5K.
- $250K Scenario: dedicated 1 FTE engineer, 1 FTE test engineer, expanded compute ($120K), formal verification subcontract, and commercialization funds.

Cost Sharing & Indirects

- This request assumes no cost-sharing. If your organization requires indirect costs, please indicate rate and we will produce a revised budget justification.
