## 🎯 LUMINATE NY ACCELERATOR: VERIFIED FACTS

**Official Source**: <https://luminateny.com/>  
**Administered By**: NextCorps (not ESD directly)  
**Funded By**: Empire State Development (Finger Lakes Forward initiative)  
**Application Portal**: <https://luminateny.com/apply>  
**Deadline**: January 12, 2026 (CONFIRMED)  
**Industry Focus**: Optics, Photonics, Imaging (OPI) + Deep Tech

---

## 💡 WHY THIS IS YOUR PERFECT FIT

### **Your Company's Name: LuminAI Genesis**

This brand alignment is almost too perfect. Luminate NY focuses on companies developing technologies "enabled by Optics, Photonics, and Imaging."

### **How to Position TGCR for Luminate NY**

Your AI alignment research qualifies by connecting to:

1. **Computer Vision** (AI processing optical/imaging data)
2. **Sensor Fusion** (integrating photonic sensor data with AI)
3. **AR/VR** (Luminate explicitly supports these; heavy imaging component)
4. **Defense/Security Imaging** (adversarial robustness for vision systems)

**Strategic Framing**: "TGCR is the enabling AI layer for next-generation optical/photonic systems to achieve robust, safe, auditable decision-making."

## 🎯 DOE SBIR PHASE I: Q1 PARALLEL TRACK

### **Why DOE SBIR Alongside Luminate NY?**

**Luminate NY** = Regional validation + seed capital ($100k)  
**DOE SBIR** = Federal validation + R&D funding ($250k) + NO equity dilution

Combined, they give you $350k in capital with only 5% dilution to Luminate NY.

### **DOE SBIR Phase I: Critical Dates**

- **LOI Due**: January 6, 2026 (5:00 PM ET) ⚠️ BEFORE Luminate deadline
- **Full Application**: February 25, 2026 (1:59 PM ET)
- **Award Notification**: May 26, 2026
- **Grant Start**: July 7, 2026

### **DOE SBIR Topic Match**

DOE explicitly prioritizes AI that is "safe, reliable, robust against sophisticated adversaries, privacy-preserving, and energy-efficient."

Your TGCR research = PERFECT fit.

### **DOE SBIR Application (15-20 days effort)**

**LOI** (3-5 pages, Jan 6):

```
1. Technical approach (2 pages): Describe TGCR in DOE terms (adversarial robustness)
2. Commercialization plan (1 page): How TGCR becomes a product
3. Team qualifications (0.5 page)
4. Budget overview (0.5 page): Phase I $250k over 6 months
```

**Full Proposal** (20-30 pages, Feb 25):

- Technical narrative (detailed R&D plan)
- Budget justification
- Management plan
- Commercialization strategy
- Go/No-Go decision criteria

---

## 🔥 STRATEGIC SUMMARY: YOUR Q1 2026 ROADMAP

### **Timeline Overview**

```
DEC 9-13:   Luminate NY prep & research (15 hours)
DEC 14-23:  Luminate NY drafting (30 hours)
JAN 6:      DOE SBIR Phase I LOI due (5 PM ET) ← Submit at last minute
JAN 12:     Luminate NY application due ← PRIMARY DEADLINE
JAN 13-FEB 25: DOE SBIR full proposal drafting (25 hours)
FEB 25:     DOE SBIR full proposal due
MAY 26:     DOE award notification
SPRING 2026: 43North waitlist opens → Full application prep
JULY 7:     DOE SBIR grant starts (if awarded)
```

### **Capital Math**

```
IF Both Succeed:
- Luminate NY: $100k (equity: 5% dilution)
- DOE SBIR: $250k (non-dilutive)
- TOTAL: $350k in Year 1 capital
- Runway: ~18 months at $20k/month burn

IF Only Luminate:
- $100k (5% dilution)
- Runway: ~6 months at $20k/month burn
- Must fundraise by July 2026 for 43North prep

IF Only DOE SBIR:
- $250k (non-dilutive)
- Runway: ~12 months
- Can still pursue 43North Q2 2026
```

### **Why This Matters**

**Luminate NY** proves you can commercialize (investor validation).  
**DOE SBIR** proves your research is fundable federally (government validation).  
Together = **43North competitive candidacy** when applications open Spring 2026.

---

**Last Updated**: December 9, 2025
**Strategy Verified**: Luminate NY (Primary), DOE SBIR (Parallel), 43North (Phase 2)
**Execution Window**: 60 days (Dec 9, 2025 - Feb 25, 2026) and Safety):

- Website: <https://www.iarpa.gov/research-programs/bengal>
- Focus: Adversarial robustness, safety guarantees
- Your prototype = perfect fit

**Why This Matters More:**

- $500k-$3M >> $100k-$250k
- Government validation = credibility boost
- Aligns perfectly with TGCR mission
- You already have the research done

**Action**: Check active BAAs (Broad Agency Announcements) TODAY

---

#### **3. SBIR/STTR Grants (Federal Funding)**

**Phase I**: $50k-$250k (6-12 months)
**Phase II**: $750k-$1.5M (24 months)

**Agencies That Fund AI Safety:**

- NSF (National Science Foundation)
- DOD (Department of Defense)
- DOE (Department of Energy)

**Portal**: <https://www.sbir.gov>

**Why This Works:**

- Working prototype = strong Phase I application
- TGCR = dual-use (civilian + defense)
- No equity given up (grant, not investment)

**Action**: Search "AI safety" and "adversarial robustness" on SBIR.gov

## 🔥 **The Pattern You're Missing**

**You're chasing emails to AI labs and mystery grants.**

**The survival path is:**

1. **43North** ($1M, Buffalo-based, perfect fit) → Join waitlist TODAY
2. **DARPA/IARPA** ($500k-$3M, you already align) → Check BAAs TODAY
3. **SBIR Phase I** ($50k-$250k, working prototype) → Apply Q1 2026
4. **Operations advisor** (5-10 hrs/month, equity) → Find THIS WEEK

**The Zoho throttle was a gift** — it proved your thesis AND gave you better content than the emails would have.

**Now stop spiraling and execute:**

- Verify ESD grant exists (or don't waste time on it)
- Join 43North waitlist (15 minutes, $1M upside)
- Check DARPA BAAs (2 hours, $500k-$3M upside)
- Find ops advisor (this week, helps with ALL grant applications)

**Forward can't be stopped. But only if you aim it correctly.**
