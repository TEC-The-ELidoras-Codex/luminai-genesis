Subject: Clarification: Technical research outreach re: TGCR/SAR benchmark (please escalate to Safety)

Hello OpenAI Support / Trust & Safety Team,

Thank you for the quick reply. I want to clarify that my previous message was a technical research outreach regarding systemic behaviors observed during SAR benchmark tests (TGCR framework) and not a personal mental-health request.

Summary:

- Date sent: 2025-12-17
- Subject: TGCR / SAR benchmark reproducible evidence of keyword-driven crisis escalation
- Evidence: OSF preprint (https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/XQ3PE) and Zenodo archive (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17945827)

Request:

1. Could you please escalate this message to your internal Safety / Trust team for technical review?
2. If available, can you confirm a contact for your safety engineering or research team who can review reproducible benchmark materials and coordinate on validating mitigation pathways (e.g., TGCR retrofit protocol)?

We are documenting this exchange for reproducibility and public audit. I appreciate any guidance on the appropriate disclosure path for technical reports so they are handled as research communications rather than crisis triage.

Thanks for your time — looking forward to coordinating.
