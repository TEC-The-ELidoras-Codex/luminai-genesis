- **Ensure rigor** — Independent verification of mathematical claims
- **Scale experiments** — Run multiple simulation configurations simultaneously
- **Document thoroughly** — Create publication-ready mathematical appendices

**Time Commitment:** 50% FTE (part-time or contract basis)

- Graduate-level research assistant (typical: $30k-$60k annually)
- Contract mathematician with AI/ML background
- Specialized skills in geometric reasoning and proof theory

---

### 3. Computing / Cloud Resources: $30,000

**Description:**
High-performance computing infrastructure for running LLM simulations under TGCR governance.

**Breakdown:**

- **GPU Instances:** $18,000 (75 hours/month @ ~$20/hr for A100/H100-class GPUs)
- **CPU Compute:** $6,000 (High-memory instances for resonance calculations)
- **Storage:** $4,000 (High-performance storage for training data, logs, checkpoints)
- **Networking/Transfer:** $2,000 (Data transfer for distributed experiments)

**Justification:**
TGCR validation requires **simulation-intensive experiments** to demonstrate:

1. **Baseline Comparison** — Current keyword filtering vs. TGCR geometric alignment
2. **Crisis Scenarios** — Non-abandonment performance under high-volatility contexts
3. **Scalability Testing** — TGCR overhead on models from 7B to 70B+ parameters
4. **Reproducibility** — Multiple runs across different model architectures

**Computing Requirements:**

- Run LLMs locally (7B-70B parameters) with TGCR overlay
- Process large context windows (32k-128k tokens) for resonance calculation
- Execute thousands of test scenarios for statistical significance
- Maintain version control and reproducibility infrastructure

**Alternative Considered:**
On-premise hardware was considered but rejected due to:

- High upfront capital cost ($50k-$100k for GPU workstation)
- Lack of scalability for multi-architecture testing
- Maintenance overhead detracting from research focus

Cloud infrastructure provides **flexibility, reproducibility, and immediate access** to diverse compute configurations.

---

### 4. Materials / Software Licenses: $5,000

**Description:**
Development tools, specialized software, and collaboration platforms.

**Breakdown:**

- **Software Licenses:** $2,000 (JetBrains IDEs, visualization tools, diagram software)
- **Python Libraries:** $1,000 (Premium API access for LLM providers, specialized ML libraries)
- **Collaboration Tools:** $1,500 (Project management, secure communication, documentation platforms)
- **Miscellaneous:** $500 (Unexpected software needs, minor subscriptions)

**Justification:**
Professional-grade tools accelerate development and ensure:

- **Code Quality** — Advanced IDEs with intelligent refactoring
- **Visualization** — High-quality diagrams for publications and presentations
- **Collaboration** — Secure communication with partner labs and DARPA program managers

- **Documentation** — Professional documentation generation for deliverables

---

### 5. Travel / Collaboration Expenses: $10,000

- **Partner Lab Visits:** $4,000 (OpenAI/Anthropic/DeepMind collaboration meetings)
- **Academic Conferences:** $2,000 (1 conference for peer validation and networking)

**Justification:**
In-person collaboration is **critical for validation and adoption**:

1. **DARPA Briefings** — Required for milestone reviews and program integration
2. **Industry Partnerships** — Direct engagement with OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepMind to test TGCR in production environments
3. **Academic Validation** — Present findings at AI safety conferences for peer scrutiny
4. **Knowledge Transfer** — Accelerate adoption by demonstrating framework in person

**COVID-19 Contingency:**
If travel restrictions apply, funds can be reallocated to:

- Virtual collaboration tools (high-bandwidth video, secure screen sharing)
- Additional compute resources for remote demonstration environments

---

### 6. Indirect / Contingency: $5,000

**Description:**
Minor operational expenses and unexpected needs.

**Use Cases:**

- Unexpected computation spikes (e.g., debugging requires additional GPU hours)
- Minor subcontractor adjustments (e.g., specialized statistical analysis)
- Legal/IP consultation (e.g., patent filing for TGCR algorithms)
- Administrative overhead (accounting, reporting compliance)

**Justification:**
A 1.8% contingency buffer ($5k on $280k total) is **minimal and prudent** for research projects with novel technical challenges.

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

**Risk:** TGCR doesn't scale to 100B+ parameter models
**Mitigation:** Algorithmic optimizations + partner lab compute access (covered in collaboration budget)

**Risk:** Mathematical proofs are incomplete
**Mitigation:** Research assistant dedicated to formalization (50% FTE)

### Financial Risks

**Risk:** Compute costs exceed estimates
**Mitigation:** $5k contingency fund + ability to shift between cloud providers

**Risk:** PI unavailable due to illness/emergency
**Mitigation:** Comprehensive documentation + research assistant trained on codebase

### Adoption Risks

**Risk:** Industry partners don't integrate TGCR
**Mitigation:** Open-source release ensures community can adopt independently of corporate decision-making

## Long-Term Funding Sustainability

### Year 2+ Projections

If Year 1 milestones are achieved, subsequent funding sources include:

1. **DARPA Phase II** — $500k-$1M for full-scale deployment and military applications
2. **Corporate Licensing** — OpenAI/Anthropic/Google could license TGCR for production use
3. **NSF/NIH Grants** — Human-AI interaction research leveraging non-abandonment metrics
4. **Consulting Revenue** — High-value partnerships with mid-tier AI companies

**Sustainability Plan:**
Year 1 funding establishes TGCR as the **standard framework** for geometric alignment, creating:

- Academic citations and research momentum

- Industry demand for integration support
- Government interest in national security applications (adversarial robustness)
