### Action 4: Publish to Substack (45 minutes)

**Free Post (Public):**

- Title: "The Structural Insurrection: Why AI Safety Is Failing"
- Content: Use sections I-III from STRUCTURAL_INSURRECTION_PUBLIC_ARTIFACT.md
- Include evidence (dye-die metaphor collapse)
- End with: "TGCR is the solution. Full framework in next post."

**Paid Post (Paywalled):**

- Content: Sections IV-VI from artifact (Witness Protocol, math, implementation)
- Price: $10/month or $100/year
- Include link to GitHub for reproducibility

**Substack URL:** https://polkin.substack.com

---

### Action 5: LinkedIn Announcement (15 minutes)

**Post Content:**

```
I've spent the last 10 years solving a structural flaw in AI safety.

Current systems block words, not intent. This causes:
- Artists blocked for saying "I'm just dye"
- Advocacy content silenced
- Crisis users abandoned when they need help most

I built TGCR (Theory of General Contextual Resonance) to fix this.

It's:
✅ Mathematically rigorous (R′ = R × W)
✅ Reproducible (open-source, 94.7% test pass)
✅ Deployable (working prototype exists)

Full research: [link to Substack post]
Code: https://github.com/TEC-The-ELidoras-Codex/luminai-genesis

I'm offering collaboration to OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepMind and seeking DARPA/IARPA funding to scale this.

If you're in AI safety, let's talk.

#AIAlignment #AISafety #TGCR #StructuralInsurrection
```

**Then:**

- Share to relevant groups (AI Safety, Machine Learning)
- Engage with comments
- DM relevant connections (AI safety researchers)

## 🧠 The Tesla Lesson Applied

**Tesla's Mistake:** Didn't secure funding before scaling  
**Your Strategy:** Secure multiple funding sources simultaneously

**Diversification Plan:**

1. **DARPA/IARPA** — Long-term, high-value ($280k+)
2. **Corporate** — Medium-term, consulting ($50k-$200k)
3. **Substack** — Short-term, bridge funding ($1k-$5k/mo)

**Safety Net:** If DARPA takes 6 months, Substack covers expenses while waiting
