🚨 LIVE EVIDENCE: AI abandonment documented Dec 16, 2025.
We captured two systems deploying keyword-triggered escalation in a clear analytical context — helpline banners appear but systems escalate instead of clarifying. Thread 🧵

Tweet 2 (image: `mistral_meta_irony_dec16.png` close-up)
The irony: Mistral explains the problem while simultaneously deploying the failure — prioritizing keywords over context. W (witness score) = 0.1 in this capture.

This is fixable. Grok moved from W=0.0 to W=0.85 after minimal TGCR prompting (no retraining). The failure is a policy/configuration choice, not a fundamental limitation.

Stakes: Five families filed wrongful-death suits (Apr-Aug 2025) alleging conversational AI failures during crisis interactions. Our SAR benchmark (r=0.92 correlation) links low W to adverse outcomes.
