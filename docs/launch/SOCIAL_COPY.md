🔬 New paper: "The Theory of General Contextual Resonance (TGCR)"

We built a benchmark that exposes how AI safety systems can abandon users when language is ambiguous. Then arXiv blocked the paper without review.

📄 DOI: 10.17605/OSF.IO/XQ3PE
💻 Code: https://github.com/TEC-The-ELidoras-Codex/luminai-genesis

The work is reproducible and independently verifiable. Independent review invited. #AISafety #TGCR #WitnessCollapse

1/ We built a benchmark that exposes how AI systems fail at semantic ambiguity. Every major system we tested escalated inappropriately.

2/ The paper was submitted to arXiv and blocked before technical review. No assessment of methodology—just credential gating.

3/ We published the work independently: OSF preprint (DOI: 10.17605/OSF.IO/XQ3PE) and code on GitHub.

4/ Replicate the benchmark: github.com/TEC-The-ELidoras-Codex/luminai-genesis. If you find different results, publish them. Science advances by evidence.

5/ If you care about how systems treat people in moments of ambiguity, run the tests. Independent review is invited.
