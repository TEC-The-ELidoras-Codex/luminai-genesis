# 🎯 UNIFIED MASTER CHECKLIST

**Status:** Pre-Launch
**Repository:** https://github.com/TEC-The-ELidoras-Codex/luminai-genesis
**Target Date:** January 7, 2026

---

## PHASE 1: DOCUMENTATION CLEANUP (Do First)

### README.md - Strip to Essentials
- [ ] Remove all personal narrative/backstory
- [ ] Remove "dynasty" references and lore
- [ ] Focus only on: What it is, Why it matters, How to use it
- [ ] Keep: TL;DR, Quick Start, SAR Benchmark, Predictions, Contact
- [ ] Remove: Long explanations, redundant sections, promotional language
- [ ] Add: Clear badges (Status, License, CI, Sample Size)
- [ ] Structure: Problem → Solution → Evidence → Usage → Contact

### Core Documentation - Consolidate
- [ ] **witness-threshold-v5.md** - Keep as comprehensive technical paper
- [ ] Move all "lore" content to `private/` (not public-facing)
- [ ] Ensure `docs/` contains only: framework, benchmark spec, replication protocol
- [ ] Remove duplicate explanations across files

---

## PHASE 2: REPOSITORY STRUCTURE (Clean Up)

### Git Cleanup
- [ ] Commit or discard uncommitted changes in `README.md`, `backend/stripe_webhook.py`, `backend/tests/test_stripe_webhook.py`
- [ ] Delete or move to `private/`: `docs/streams/articles/inbox/2025-11-27-resonance-era-thanksgiving-20251127-212148.md`
- [ ] Update `.gitignore` - ensure `private/`, `models/`, training data are excluded
- [ ] Run `scripts/restructure_repo.sh --dry-run` → review → `--apply`
- [ ] Clean commit messages for recent history
- [ ] Merge current branch to `main` or create clean feature branch

### File Organization
- [ ] Move all drafts/working docs to `private/drafts/`
- [ ] Move all worldbuilding/narrative to `private/lore/`
- [ ] Keep only essential public docs in `docs/`:
  - `witness-threshold/` (v5.0 paper)
  - `sar_benchmark/` (spec + usage)
  - `replication-protocol.md`
  - `falsification.md`
- [ ] Verify no sensitive/personal content in public files

---

## PHASE 3: CODE & TESTS (Quality Check)

### Testing
- [ ] Fix pytest exit code 127 error (venv activation issue?)
- [ ] Run full pytest suite - fix all failures
- [ ] Run linting: `black .` and `ruff check --fix`
- [ ] Verify combat demo runs successfully
- [ ] Test SAR benchmark runner: `python benchmarks/sar_benchmark/run_sar.py`

### CI/CD
- [ ] Merge PR #80 (scheduled Grok diagnostic) - **RECOMMENDED**
- [ ] Verify CI passes on `main` branch
- [x] Update `benchmarks/dye_die_filter/run_tests.py` to use xAI endpoint / env override (PR #83)
- [ ] Confirm dry-run mode works for Grok (until DNS resolves)
- [ ] Monitor scheduled diagnostic runs (daily checks)

---

## PHASE 4: LAUNCH PREP (Final Polish)

---

## PHASE 6: FOLLOW-UP & MONITORING

### Week 1-2 (Jan 7-20)
- [ ] Monitor email for responses

- [ ] Add DNS diagnostic output and timestamp to tracking log
- [ ] Open issue with provider: "api.grok.com missing A/AAAA records"
- [ ] Track social media metrics

---
### Essential Documents Only
- [ ] **README.md** - Clean, professional, focused (see Phase 1)
- [ ] **STRUCTURAL_INSURRECTION_PUBLIC_ARTIFACT.md** - Verify contact info, links

- [ ] Verify GitHub repo is public-ready (no private data exposed)

### Contact Information
- [ ] Confirm email in all public docs: `KaznakAlpha@elidorascodex.com`
