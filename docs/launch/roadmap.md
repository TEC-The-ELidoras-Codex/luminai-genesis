# Quantum Security Roadmap (2025–2035)

**Document:** roadmap.md
**Last updated:** 2025-12-11

## High-level milestones

- **2025 — Baseline / Transition**

  - Adopt NIST PQC-approved algorithms for targeted workloads
  - Implement hybrid (classical + PQC) modes for TLS and KMS
  - Begin QKD feasibility testing with partners

- **2026–2028 — Harden & Expand**

  - Upgrade to newer PQC standards as they emerge
  - Expand PQC coverage across more services and APIs
  - Begin pilot QKD deployments for critical links

- **2029–2032 — Integration**

  - Broader QKD integration and quantum-secure API rollout
  - Start integrating quantum-safe storage and cloud network links
  - Establish industry partnerships for interoperability

- **2033–2035 — Quantum Internet Compatibility**
  - Participate in quantum network standardization
  - Achieve compatibility modes for quantum-enabled infrastructure
  - Maintain continuous upgrade path and audits

## Year-by-year actions (short)

- **2025:** PQC baseline, hybrid TLS, KMS re-wrap utilities, initial QKD testing
- **2026:** Full PQC rollout for public-facing APIs, internal audit
- **2027:** Replace legacy RSA/ECC on selected services; begin wide-scale client libraries upgrade
- **2028:** PQC 2.0 adoption, increased automation for key rotations
- **2029:** QKD expansion for partner links; standardize encryption metadata
- **2030:** Quantum-aware threat monitoring and analytics
- **2032:** Operational quantum network trials
- **2035:** Support for quantum-network endpoints and continual compliance

## Governance

- Security & Compliance will publish annual quantum security audit summaries
- Major algorithm migrations require cross-functional approval and a fixed rollback plan
