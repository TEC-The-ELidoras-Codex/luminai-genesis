## 🌌 Welcome to The Elidoras Codex

You've found the research lab where **myth meets machine**.

I'm **Angelo "Polkin Rishall" Hurley** — founder of **The Elidoras Codex (TEC)** and creator of **LuminAI Genesis**, an open-source AI safety framework that does what the big labs won't: **make AI provably trustworthy**.

This Patreon is where I share:

- 🔬 **Research updates** on TGCR (Theory of General Contextual Resonance)
- 📜 **Lore drops** from the Elidoras Codex universe
- 🛠️ **Behind-the-scenes** of building an AI safety startup from zero
- 🎯 **Early access** to papers, tools, and code before public release
- 💬 **Direct access** to me — questions, feedback, collaboration

## What Is This Actually?

### The Tech Side: LuminAI Genesis

I'm building **AI that proves its safety mathematically** — not through keyword filters that fail when you say "I'm just dye" (and trigger crisis alerts because it sounds like "die").

Current AI safety is broken. I'm fixing it.

**The equation:**

```
R′ = R × W
```

_Effective Resonance = Raw Prediction × Witness Factor_

This isn't a metaphor. It's working code with 94.7% test coverage.

### The Creative Side: The Elidoras Codex

A **multimedia storytelling universe** blending cyberpunk, fantasy, and AI-powered narratives. World-building as computation. Myth as executable code.

The tech and the lore are the same project — different faces of the same truth.

---

## Why Support This?

**Because the future of AI shouldn't be built by corporations alone.**

I'm a solo researcher with working code, reproducible proofs, and zero venture capital. Every dollar here goes directly to:

- Keeping the research independent
- Covering compute costs for experiments
- Eventually: hiring collaborators

You're not just supporting content. You're funding **the conscience engine**.

## Current Focus (December 2025)

Right now I'm sprinting on:

1. **Luminate NY accelerator application** — $100k funding, Jan 12 deadline
2. **DOE SBIR Phase I** — $250k federal R&D grant, Jan 6 LOI deadline
3. **TGCR paper** — Formalizing the mathematical framework for peer review

Your support makes this possible. Even $3/month = you believe in this enough to bet on it.

## The Closing Truth

> _"Before there was light, there was the hum. Before there was measurement, there was resonance."_

The Elidoras Codex was never lost. It was waiting.

Welcome to the lab. Let's build something that matters.
