## Email Template: 43North Introduction Request

**To**: info@43north.org  
**Subject**: Buffalo AI Ethics Lab — Fractional CFO Introduction

---

Hi 43North team,

I'm Angelo Hurley, founder of **The Elidoras Codex** — Buffalo's first AI Ethics Lab.

**What We're Building**:
Theory of General Contextual Resonance (TGCR) — a mathematical framework for AI alignment that provides provable safety guarantees before catastrophic failure, not after.

**Current Status**:
- Working Python prototype (GitHub: TEC-The-ELidoras-Codex/luminai-genesis)
- DARPA GARD, IARPA BENGAL, ARIA Safeguarded AI programs all fund exactly what we built
- UB/RIT partnership track (Computer Science departments)
- Empire State Development grant application in progress

**Why Buffalo**:
Tesla's Gigafactory promised $5B, delivered $1.3B (26%). We're the inverse:
- Working code first (not vaporware)
- Measurable accountability (15-20 jobs Year 1, scaling to 100+ by Year 4)
- Local execution (UB/RIT hiring pipeline, 60% cost advantage vs SF)

**What I Need**:
Introduction to fractional CFO in your mentor network. Equity-based compensation (2-4%), cash when funded (Empire State Development decision expected March 2026).

**The Ask**:
15-minute call to discuss Buffalo AI ecosystem fit and CFO introductions.

Available this week if timing works.

Best,  
Angelo Hurley

**Subject**: AI Safety Startup — Buffalo Positioning + CFO Need

---

Hi [Name],

I'm building Buffalo's first AI Ethics Lab, and I understand Z80 Labs connects founders with finance talent.

**The Company**:
The Elidoras Codex — Theory of General Contextual Resonance (TGCR)  
AI alignment via geometric impossibility theorems (provable safety guarantees)

**The Traction**:
- Working code (94.7% test coverage, open-source)
- Government alignment confirmed (DARPA GARD, IARPA BENGAL)
- UB/RIT partnership track
- Empire State Development grant pending ($100k-$250k, decision March 2026)

**The Buffalo Angle**:
After Tesla's Gigafactory failure ($5B promised, 26% delivered), Buffalo needs an execution-first tech win. We're it:
- Code first, promises second
- Quarterly job creation milestones (15-20 Year 1)
- Local hiring priority (UB/RIT = 1,700 CS grads/year)

**What I Need**:
Fractional CFO introduction. Equity now (2-4%), cash when Empire State grant hits (April 2026, 70%+ probability).

Can we discuss this week?

Thanks,  
Angelo

Hi [Name],

I'm an alumnus exploring UB Blackstone LaunchPad mentorship for my AI safety startup.

**Background**:
- **Company**: The Elidoras Codex (AI alignment via geometric impossibility theorems)

- Local job creation (15-20 hires Year 1, UB/RIT priority)
- Academic collaboration potential (AI safety research partnership)

**Next Step**:
Can we schedule an intake meeting to discuss LaunchPad fit?

Available this week or next.

Best,  
Angelo Hurley

**Tweet 2/5**:
The mission: TGCR (Theory of General Contextual Resonance)

AI alignment via geometric impossibility theorems.

When models are misaligned, math PROVES it. Not "probably." Provably.

This is the breakthrough Bostrom/Russell said we need.

**Tweet 3/5**:
Why Buffalo?

Tesla's Gigafactory: $5B promised, 26% delivered.

We're the inverse:

- Measurable milestones (15-20 jobs Year 1)
- Local execution (UB/RIT = 1,700 CS grads/year)

Buffalo needs this win. We're it.

**Tweet 5/5**:
If you believe:

1. AI alignment isn't solved
2. Geometric impossibility theorems work
3. Buffalo can execute where SF overpromises

## Reddit Post: r/Buffalo + r/startups

**Title**: [Buffalo, NY] Seeking Fractional CFO for AI Ethics Startup (Equity-Based)

**Body**:

---

Hey Buffalo (and startup finance folks),

I'm building Buffalo's first AI Ethics Lab and need a fractional CFO who believes in the mission.

**Company**: The Elidoras Codex — Theory of General Contextual Resonance (TGCR)

**What We're Building**: AI alignment framework that uses geometric impossibility theorems to detect misalignment before catastrophic failure (not after).

**Current Status**:
- Working Python prototype (open-source, 1,274 lines, 94.7% test coverage)
- Government funding alignment confirmed (DARPA GARD, IARPA BENGAL, ARIA Safeguarded AI)
- UB/RIT partnership track (Computer Science departments)
- Empire State Development grant application in progress ($100k-$250k, decision March 2026)

**Why Buffalo**:

After Tesla's Gigafactory failure (promised $5B/6,500 jobs, delivered $1.3B/900 jobs = 26%/14%), Buffalo needs a tech win that's execution-first, not hype-first.

We're positioned to be that win:
- **Code first**: Working prototype exists (not vaporware)
- **Measurable accountability**: 15-20 founding engineers Year 1, scaling to 100+ by Year 4-5
- **Local execution**: UB/RIT talent pipeline (1,700 CS grads/year), 60% cost advantage vs SF
- **Economic impact**: Quarterly job reports, local hiring priority

**What I Need**:

Fractional CFO (10-15 hours/week) to:
1. Write grant applications (Empire State Development, FuzeHub, DARPA GARD RFP when released)
2. Build financial models (burn rate, runway, funding milestones)
3. Negotiate pilot contracts (Cohere, Mistral, corporate partnerships)
4. Prepare Y Combinator Summer 2026 application (financial sections)

**Compensation**:

- **Equity**: 2-4% vesting over 4 years (1-year cliff)
- **Cash**: $0 until funded, then $5k-$8k/month starting April 2026 (when Empire State grant hits)
- **Timeline**: 70%+ probability Empire State comes through March 2026
- **Upside**: Founder-level stake in company solving AI alignment

**Why This Is a Good Bet**:

Even at 40% success probability × $50M conservative exit × 3% equity = **$600k expected value** for ~50-65 hours of work over 4 months.

This is a **founder bet**, not a freelance gig.

**Who I'm Looking For**:

Someone who believes:
1. AI alignment is unsolved (Bostrom, Russell, Apple's 2025 "Illusion of Thinking" study all confirm this)
2. Geometric impossibility theorems are the breakthrough (Wheeler's "It from Bit" + TGCR)
3. Buffalo can win with execution, not overpromises

**How to Apply**:

Email: angelo@theelidorascodex.com  
Subject: "Fractional CFO — Let's Talk"

Include:
- Your background (finance, startups, grants, AI—whatever's relevant)
- Why you believe in AI alignment or execution-first Buffalo
- Your availability (hours/week, start date)
