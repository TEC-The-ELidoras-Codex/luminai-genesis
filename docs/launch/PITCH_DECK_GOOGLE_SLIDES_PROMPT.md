## 🎯 MASTER PROMPT FOR GOOGLE SLIDES

**Copy everything below the line into Google Slides AI:**

---

Create a 10-slide professional startup pitch deck for LuminAI Genesis, an AI safety company applying to Luminate NY accelerator (optics, photonics, and imaging focused). Use modern, clean design with these specifications:

### STYLE REQUIREMENTS

**Color Palette (matches official LuminAI Genesis branding):**

- Primary: Deep purple (#6b46c1) - the radiant core of the logo
- Secondary: Soft teal (#5fb3b3) - represents flow and connection
- Tertiary: Warm amber/gold (#d4a574) - represents warmth and value
- Accent: Soft lavender (#a78bfa) - ethereal, AI consciousness
- Background: Clean white (#ffffff) or very light gray (#f7fafc)
- Text: Dark charcoal (#2d3748) for readability

**Typography:**

- Headlines: Bold, modern sans-serif (like Montserrat or similar)
- Body: Clean sans-serif (like Open Sans or similar)
- Use large font sizes - this will be viewed on screens, not printed

**Visual Style:**

- Use the official LuminAI Genesis logo (geometric star with interlocking curves)
- The logo represents convergence — the center point is the Witness, flowing lines are contextual resonance
- Geometric patterns subtly in backgrounds (represents "geometric AI")
- Minimal icons - one per slide maximum
- No clip art - use abstract shapes if needed
- Lots of white space - don't crowd the slides
- Graph/chart style: Simple, flat, professional

**Layout Rules:**

- One key message per slide
- Headlines at top, supporting info below
- Use the "rule of thirds" for visual balance
- No more than 6 bullet points per slide (prefer 3-4)
- Include subtle geometric grid lines as design element

---

### SLIDE 1: TITLE SLIDE

**Layout**: Centered, dramatic

**Content**:

- Use the official LuminAI Genesis logo (geometric star with purple core, interlocking teal/lavender/amber curves)
- Company name: **LuminAI Genesis**
- Tagline: "Mathematical Safety for AI Vision Systems"
- Subtext: "Luminate NY Application | January 2026"
- Small text at bottom: "Angelo Hurley, Founder"

**Design notes**: Clean, confident, no clutter. The geometric logo represents convergence — center point is the Witness, flowing lines are contextual resonance. Background should be clean white with subtle geometric grid pattern in very light gray. Do NOT use runes or cosmic backgrounds — keep it professional.

---

### SLIDE 2: THE PROBLEM

**Layout**: Left text, right visual

**Headline**: "AI Vision Systems Are Dangerously Unpredictable"

**Content (left side)**:

- Bullet: Self-driving cars fail on edge cases—people die
- Bullet: Medical imaging AI misses critical diagnoses
- Bullet: Defense systems can't prove their decisions are safe
- Bullet: $54B autonomous vehicle market blocked by trust gap

**Visual (right side)**:

- Abstract representation of an AI making a wrong decision
- Could be a crossroads with a question mark, or fragmented/broken geometric shapes
- Red accent color to show danger

**Footer stat**: "94% of autonomous vehicle accidents involve AI perception failures"

---

### SLIDE 3: WHY THIS HAPPENS

**Layout**: Full-width diagram

**Headline**: "Current AI Guesses. It Cannot Prove."

**Content**:
Show a simple before/after comparison:

**LEFT BOX - "Current AI"**:

- Input: Image of road
- Process: Black box neural network (show as opaque dark cube)
- Output: "Car detected" (yes/no only)
- Problem: "No way to know confidence level or failure modes"

**RIGHT BOX - "With TGCR"**:

- Input: Same image
- Process: Geometric framework (show as transparent crystalline structure)
- Output: "Car detected with 97.3% bounded confidence"
- Benefit: "Mathematical proof of decision reliability"

**Design notes**: Use arrows showing flow. Left side has red warning indicators, right side has green check marks.

---

### SLIDE 4: THE SOLUTION - TGCR

**Layout**: Centered with equation

**Headline**: "Theory of General Contextual Resonance"

**Core Visual**:
Large, beautifully formatted equation:

**R′ = R × W**

Below the equation, in clean layout:

- **R** = Raw AI prediction (model output)
- **W** = Witness factor (contextual coherence proof)
- **R′** = Auditable, bounded confidence

**Supporting text**:
"TGCR provides geometric proofs that AI decisions are bounded and trustworthy—before deployment, not after failure."

**Design notes**: The equation should be the hero of this slide. Use the teal accent color. Make it memorable and clean.

---

### SLIDE 5: HOW IT WORKS (SIMPLIFIED)

**Layout**: Three-column visual

**Headline**: "From Black Box to Glass Box"

**Three columns**:

**Column 1 - "MEASURE"**

- Icon: Geometric measuring tool
- Text: "Analyze contextual coherence across multiple input dimensions"

**Column 2 - "BOUND"**

- Icon: Mathematical brackets
- Text: "Calculate provable confidence intervals with geometric proofs"

**Column 3 - "VERIFY"**

- Icon: Checkmark in shield
- Text: "Audit every decision with reproducible mathematical evidence"

**Footer**: "1,274 lines of Python | 94.7% test coverage | 100% reproducible"

---

### SLIDE 6: OPTICS, PHOTONICS, IMAGING FIT

**Layout**: Left headline, right visual/icons

**Headline**: "Built for the OPI Ecosystem"

**Content**:
TGCR makes AI provably safe for:

- ✅ **Computer Vision** — Autonomous vehicles, robotics, manufacturing QC
- ✅ **LiDAR + Sensor Fusion** — Drones, self-driving, defense systems
- ✅ **Medical Imaging** — Radiology AI, surgical guidance, diagnostics
- ✅ **AR/VR** — Safety-critical augmented reality, industrial applications

**Right side visual**:
Abstract representation showing photonic beams converging through a geometric crystalline structure (representing TGCR processing optical data)

**Footer**: "Rochester is the global optics capital. LuminAI Genesis belongs here."

---

### SLIDE 7: MARKET OPPORTUNITY

**Layout**: Large numbers with supporting context

**Headline**: "A $340B Problem Waiting for a Solution"

**Key figures** (display as large, bold numbers):

- **$54B** — Autonomous vehicle market (2025)
- **$197B** — Computer vision market (2028)
- **$89B** — Medical imaging AI market (2030)

**Our initial target**:

- **$2.5B** — Safety-critical AI certification market
- Focus: Companies that MUST prove their AI works

**Growth driver quote**:
"Without provable AI safety, autonomy markets remain blocked. TGCR unlocks them."
