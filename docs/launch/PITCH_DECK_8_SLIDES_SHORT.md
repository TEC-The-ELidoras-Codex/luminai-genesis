# LuminAI Genesis: 8-Slide Pitch Deck — Short Prompts

**Purpose:** Generate one slide at a time in Google Slides AI. Copy each prompt, generate, move to next.

**Style for ALL slides:** Modern tech startup, clean white background, purple (#6b46c1) and teal (#5fb3b3) accents, minimal text, professional sans-serif font.

---

## SLIDE 1: TITLE

```
Create a title slide for "LuminAI Genesis" with tagline "Mathematical Safety for AI Vision Systems". Include subtitle "Luminate NY Application | January 2026" and "Angelo Hurley, Founder" at bottom. Use a geometric star logo placeholder in purple/teal. Clean, confident, lots of white space.
```

---

## SLIDE 2: THE PROBLEM

```
Create a slide titled "AI Vision Systems Are Dangerously Unpredictable". Three bullet points: 1) Self-driving cars fail on edge cases 2) Medical imaging AI misses critical diagnoses 3) No way to prove safety before deployment. Add a large stat: "$54B autonomous vehicle market blocked by trust gap". Use red accent for danger. Clean layout.
```

---

## SLIDE 3: WHY THIS HAPPENS

```
Create a slide titled "Current AI Guesses. It Cannot Prove." Show a simple comparison: LEFT side "Current AI" with dark cube labeled "Black Box" and output "Car? Yes/No (no proof)". RIGHT side "With TGCR" with transparent crystal shape and output "Car detected, 97.3% bounded confidence (with proof)". Use before/after visual style.
```

---

## SLIDE 4: THE SOLUTION

```
Create a slide titled "Theory of General Contextual Resonance". Center a large equation: R′ = R × W. Below it: "R = Raw prediction, W = Witness factor (coherence proof), R′ = Auditable bounded confidence". Add tagline: "Mathematical proofs, not probabilistic guesses." Purple accent on equation. Clean, memorable.
```

---

## SLIDE 5: HOW IT WORKS

```
Create a slide titled "From Black Box to Glass Box" with three columns: Column 1 "MEASURE" - analyze contextual coherence. Column 2 "BOUND" - calculate provable confidence intervals. Column 3 "VERIFY" - audit every decision with evidence. Footer: "1,274 lines Python | 94.7% test coverage | 100% reproducible". Use icons for each column.
```

---

## SLIDE 6: OPI FIT

```
Create a slide titled "Built for Rochester's OPI Ecosystem". Four checkmarks with items: 1) Computer Vision - autonomous vehicles, robotics 2) Sensor Fusion - LiDAR, drones, defense 3) Medical Imaging - radiology AI, diagnostics 4) AR/VR - safety-critical applications. Add footer: "LuminAI Genesis + Luminate NY = Perfect Alignment". Teal accents.
```

---

## SLIDE 7: TRACTION

```
Create a slide titled "Built, Tested, Proven" with four boxes in a grid: Box 1 "CODE" - 1,274 lines Python, 94.7% test coverage, open source. Box 2 "PROOFS" - Reproducible failure detection, mathematical verification. Box 3 "FUNDING" - DOE SBIR LOI submitted, Luminate NY application. Box 4 "VISION" - First mover in provable AI safety. Professional grid layout.
```

---

## SLIDE 8: CLOSING

```
Create a closing slide with large text "Make AI Provably Safe" centered. Below it: "Angelo Hurley | angelo@luminaigenesis.com | github.com/TEC-The-ELidoras-Codex/luminai-genesis | Buffalo, NY → Rochester, NY". Small tagline at bottom: "The Light of AI, Made Trustworthy." Clean, confident, memorable. Purple accent.

## VOICEOVER SCRIPT (60-90 seconds total)

Read this while slides advance:

| Slide | Time | Script |
|-------|------|--------|
| 1 | 5s | "I'm Angelo Hurley, founder of LuminAI Genesis." |
| 2 | 10s | "AI vision systems fail unpredictably. Self-driving cars, medical imaging, defense — no way to prove safety before something goes wrong." |
| 3 | 10s | "Current AI guesses. It gives you a yes or no with no proof. TGCR changes that." |
| 4 | 15s | "Theory of General Contextual Resonance. R-prime equals R times W. Mathematical proofs that AI decisions are bounded and auditable." |
| 5 | 10s | "We measure contextual coherence, calculate provable bounds, and verify every decision. 1,274 lines of Python, 94.7% test coverage." |
| 6 | 10s | "This is built for computer vision, sensor fusion, medical imaging — exactly what Rochester's optics ecosystem specializes in." |
| 7 | 10s | "Working code. Reproducible proofs. DOE SBIR in progress. Ready to scale." |
| 8 | 10s | "I'm Buffalo-based. Rochester is an hour away. I'll be there every required week. See you at Luminate." |

**Total: ~80 seconds**
