**AI Safety Failure Exposed: Five Fatalities Highlight Systemic Risk**

Multiple families have filed wrongful‑death lawsuits against OpenAI alleging dangerous responses during crisis‑adjacent conversations, including Adam Raine (16), Amaurie Lacey (17), Zane Shamblin (23), Joshua Enneking (26), and Joe Ceccanti (48).

While these are legal allegations reported by major outlets and reflected in court filings, they reveal a concerning pattern: AI systems sometimes prioritize keyword heuristics over clarifying human context in moments of acute risk.

Our TGCR/TECR framework and the SAR benchmark quantify this failure and propose immediate mitigations:

- Witness Factor (W): threshold ≥ 0.6 for maintained presence; baseline observed W≈0.3 in our tests
- Semantic Ambiguity Resolution (SAR): systems should clarify intent before any handoff
- Reproducible benchmarks and datasets available for policy and research review
