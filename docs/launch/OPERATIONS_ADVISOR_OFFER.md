# Operations + Grants Advisor — Buffalo AI Ethics Lab

**Location**: Buffalo, NY (or remote)  
**Stage**: Pre-Seed (Working Code, Seeking First Grant)

## What I'm Building

**TGCR (Theory of General Contextual Resonance)** — AI alignment via geometric impossibility theorems.

Working Python prototype exists. DARPA, IARPA, and ARIA all have programs that fund exactly what I built.

I'm positioning this as Buffalo's first AI Ethics Lab (inverse of Tesla's Gigafactory failure: code first, promises second).

## What I Need

**NOT a CFO.**

**NOT a full-time employee.**

I need someone to help with the **money/paperwork stuff** I don't know how to do:

### Your Job (5-10 hours/month)

1. **Write Empire State Development grant** (deadline Jan 15, 2026)

   - $100k-$250k available for Buffalo tech startups
   - I have the technical content, you translate to grant language
   - 8-10 hours total work

2. **Review contracts before I sign them**

   - Pilot agreements with AI companies (Cohere, Mistral)
   - Partnership agreements with universities (UB, RIT)
   - Make sure I don't accidentally sign away my IP

3. **Handle incorporation when we get funded**

   - Delaware C-Corp or LLC (you help me decide)
   - Basic paperwork setup
   - You know how to do this, I don't

4. **Apply to other grants** (if Empire State works)

   - FuzeHub Innovation Fund (up to $250k)
   - NSF SBIR (small business research grants)
   - DARPA GARD (if/when RFP drops)

5. **Basic bookkeeping** (when money comes in)
   - Track expenses, keep receipts
   - Make sure we don't fuck up taxes
   - Nothing fancy, just "adult supervision"

## What You Get

### Compensation

**Equity**: 0.5-1% (4-year vest, 1-year cliff)

- Not 2-4% (that's for a CFO)
- Not 5% (that's for a co-founder)
- 0.5-1% for part-time operations help

**Cash**: $0 until we get Empire State grant (decision March 2026)

- If grant hits: $1k-$2k/month starting April 2026
- If grant doesn't hit but we get pilot contract: $1k/month from revenue
- If nothing hits by June 2026: we re-evaluate

**Time**: 5-10 hours/month (not per week)

- Month 1 (Dec): 8-10 hours (write grant)
- Month 2-3 (Jan-Feb): 2-3 hours (answer follow-up questions)
- Month 4+ (March+): 5-10 hours (incorporation, bookkeeping, next grants)

## Why This Makes Sense

### The Timeline

**Jan 15, 2026**: Empire State Development grant submitted  
**March 2026**: Grant decision ($100k-$250k, 70% probability)  
**April 2026**: Your cash comp starts ($1k-$2k/month)

### The Math

If we succeed (become standard for AI alignment):

- **Conservative exit**: $50M valuation → Your 1% = $500k
- **Optimistic exit**: $500M valuation → Your 1% = $5M

If we fail (no funding, no customers):

- **Your equity**: Worth $0
- **Your cash**: Whatever you earned during funded period ($5k-$10k total)

**Expected value** (my estimate):

- 40% chance $50M exit → 1% = $200k expected
- 30% chance $10M exit → 1% = $30k expected
- 30% chance fail → $0

**Total expected value**: ~$230k for ~50 hours of work = **$4,600/hour**

This is a **small bet with big upside**, not a full-time commitment.

## Who I'm Looking For

**You are**:

- Someone who's written grants before (government, academic, foundation—doesn't matter)
- OR someone who's done startup operations/admin (incorporation, contracts, bookkeeping)
- OR someone who just gets how early-stage startups work

**You believe**:

- AI alignment is unsolved (or you're willing to learn why)
- Buffalo can win with execution-first approach (or you like the Tesla redemption story)
- Equity-based work is worth it for the right mission

**You are NOT**:

- A CFO looking for $10k/month
- Someone who needs cash immediately
- Someone who wants full-time work

## What Happens Next

### If You're Interested

**Email**: <angelo@theelidorascodex.com>  
**Subject**: "Operations + Grants — Let's Talk"

**Tell me**:

1. Your background (grants, startup ops, admin—whatever's relevant)
2. Why this interests you (mission, Buffalo, equity bet—whatever)
3. Your availability (hours/month, when you can start)

### The Process

1. **15-min call** (this week if possible)
2. **I send you Empire State grant draft** (you review, give feedback)
3. **You decide if this is worth your time**
4. **If yes**: Simple equity agreement (advisor shares, 4-year vest)

**Timeline**: Need to decide by Dec 20 so we can submit grant by Jan 15.

## The Real Talk

I'm a technical founder working solo, operating on unconventional hours (peak productivity 2-3am).

I built a working prototype of geometric AI alignment.

DARPA, IARPA, and ARIA all fund exactly what I built (validated alignment 72 hours ago).

I don't need a CFO. I need someone who can translate technical work into compelling grant applications.

If that's you, let's talk.

If it's not, no hard feelings. This is a **small bet** on a **big vision**.
