## 🚀 POST-SUBMISSION TIMELINE

**May 26, 2026**: DOE SBIR Phase I award notification (expected)
**Q2 2026**: Luminate NY notification (selected or waitlisted)
**July 7, 2026**: DOE SBIR grant start date (if awarded)
**Summer 2026**: Begin Luminate NY 7-month accelerator in Rochester (if selected)

**Q2/Q3 2026**: Use Luminate NY capital + DOE SBIR funding to:
- Hire 2-3 engineers
- Build customer traction
- Prove revenue model
- Generate case studies

**Spring 2026**: Prepare for 43North accelerator application (opens Spring, decisions Q2/Q3)

---

## 💡 RISK MITIGATION STRATEGIES

### **If Luminate NY application is weak:**
- Doesn't matter, you have DOE SBIR ($250k) as backup
- Use SBIR funding to build traction for 43North later
- Apply for FuzeHub Microelectronics Challenge (opens Jan 5)

### **If DOE SBIR LOI is rejected:**
- You still have Luminate NY ($100k) as primary funding
- Full proposal is due Feb 25 anyway; can still improve and submit
- Luminate $100k keeps you solvent for 6 months

### **If both are rejected:**
- You have 43North ($1M) opening Spring 2026
- Apply for NSF SBIR (rolling deadlines, less competitive than DOE)
- Pursue FuzeHub Microelectronics Challenge and Commercialization Competition
- Use Substack + GitHub to attract angel investors

### **If you get stuck on OPI positioning:**
- Email Luminate NY: "Is my OPI narrative clear?" (info@luminateny.com)
- They want to help good teams succeed; ask for guidance
- Worst case: Pivot to computer vision (obvious OPI connection)

---

## 📝 DECISION TREES

### **Should I focus on Luminate NY or DOE SBIR?**

**Answer**: BOTH, in parallel. But if forced to choose:
- **Luminate NY first**: It's more competitive, accelerator value is huge
- **DOE SBIR second**: Non-dilutive, longer timeline, but more sustainable

### **What if I don't have an obvious OPI connection?**

**Options**:
1. **Computer Vision**: Frame TGCR as "AI for optical/imaging data processing"
2. **Sensor Fusion**: "Integrating optical/photonic sensor data with AI"
3. **AR/VR**: "Auditable AI for vision-based augmented reality"
4. **Defense/Security**: "Hardening AI systems processing optical surveillance"

Pick ONE and commit to it for the entire application.

### **Should I hire an operations advisor?**

**Yes, if**:
- You're overwhelmed with application writing
- You've never written SBIR/grant applications before
- You need someone to manage timelines and deadlines

**No, if**:
- You have free time and enjoy administrative work
- You've written grants before
- You can get help from mentors/advisors

**Middle ground**: Hire part-time advisor for DOE SBIR full proposal (Feb-Feb), not Luminate NY.
