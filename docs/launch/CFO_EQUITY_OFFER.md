## The Compensation Structure

### Phase 1: Pre-Seed (Now → March 2026)

**Equity**: 0.5-2% vesting over 4 years (1-year cliff)

- **Rationale**: Founding engineer equity (employee #1-3 range)
- **Vesting**: Standard 4-year vest, 25% after year 1, monthly thereafter
- **Type**: ISO (Incentive Stock Options) if U.S.-based, NSO otherwise
- **Range**: 0.5% for part-time contributors, 1.5-2% for full co-founder commitment

**Cash**: $0/month (deferred to Phase 2)

- **Why**: Company pre-revenue, runway preservation critical
- **Alternative**: If cash needed immediately, we can discuss contract-to-hire or revenue-share from pilot contracts

**Time Commitment**: Flexible (10-40 hours/week)

- **Part-Time (10-15 hrs/week)**: 0.5-0.75% equity, specific project focus
- **Half-Time (20-25 hrs/week)**: 1-1.25% equity, core system ownership
- **Full-Time (40+ hrs/week)**: 1.5-2% equity, co-founder level contribution
- **Async-Friendly**: I work 2-3am, you set your hours. Output matters, not schedules.

---

### Phase 2: Seed Secured ($280k+ raised)

**Equity**: Same initial grant (continues vesting)

- No dilution from Phase 1
- Refresher grants possible at Series A based on performance

**Cash**: Market rate based on role + location

- **ML Engineer/Research Scientist**: $8k-$12k/month ($96k-$144k annual)
- **Data Scientist**: $7k-$10k/month ($84k-$120k annual)
- **Backend/Full-Stack Engineer**: $7k-$11k/month ($84k-$132k annual)
- **Buffalo-Based**: Lower end of range (lower COL)
- **Remote (SF/NYC cost basis)**: Higher end of range

**Time Commitment**: Scales with funding

- Part-time transitions to half-time or full-time as runway extends

---

### Phase 3: Series A ($2M+ raised)

**Equity**: Refresher grant (0.25-0.5% at new valuation)

- **Rationale**: Reward for achieving Product-Market Fit
- **Path to Senior/Lead/Principal**: IC track progression available
- **Path to Management**: Engineering Manager/Director if team-building focus

**Cash**: $120k-$180k base (full-time, market rate)

- **Senior Engineer**: $120k-$150k + refresher equity
- **Lead/Staff Engineer**: $140k-$170k + refresher equity
- **Principal Engineer**: $160k-$200k + refresher equity
- **Engineering Manager**: $140k-$180k + team equity pool

**Time Commitment**: Full-time expected at Series A stage

---

## Why This Equity Structure Works

### Funding Timeline (High Confidence)

**Q1 2026 (Jan-Mar)**:

- **Empire State Development**: Decision expected by March 2026 ($100k-$250k)
- **Probability**: 70%+ (Buffalo-based tech startup, job creation focus, Tesla lesson narrative)

**Q1-Q2 2026 (Jan-Jun)**:

- **DARPA GARD RFP**: Expected release Q1 2026, awards Q2-Q3 ($1M-$3M if selected)
- **Probability**: 40-60% (strong technical alignment, but competitive)

**Q2 2026 (Apr-Jun)**:

- **Corporate Pilots**: Cohere or Mistral pilot contract ($50k-$150k)
- **Probability**: 60%+ (warm conversations ongoing, working code exists)

**Q3 2026 (Jul-Sep)**:

- **Y Combinator Summer 2026**: $500k for 7% (if accepted)
- **Probability**: 20-30% (competitive but strong fit: AI safety, government traction, Buffalo unfair advantage)

### Worst-Case Scenario (Conservative)

Even if **only Empire State Development** comes through ($100k-$250k by March 2026):

- **Your Cash Comp Starts**: April 2026 (4 months from now)
- **Runway**: 12-18 months of operations funded
- **Your Monthly**: $5k-$8k begins immediately upon funding

### Best-Case Scenario (Optimistic but Realistic)

If **Empire State + Pilot Contract** hit by June 2026 ($150k + $100k = $250k):

- **Your Cash Comp**: $8k/month starting June 2026
- **Annual Run Rate**: $96k for part-time work
- **Equity Value**: 2-4% of company that just proved execution (likely $5M-$10M valuation at Seed)

---

## The Tesla Lesson

**What Tesla Did Wrong (Buffalo Gigafactory)**:

- **Promised**: $5B investment, 6,500 jobs, 2014 announcement
- **Delivered**: $1.3B investment (26%), 900 jobs (14%), 2020 failure
- **Result**: Buffalo's most famous tech failure, political embarrassment, economic loss

**What We're Doing Right**:

- **Code First**: Working prototype exists (not slides, not promises)
- **Measurable Milestones**: Quarterly job creation targets (15-20 Year 1, scaling to 100+ by Year 4)
- **Local Accountability**: UB/RIT partnership, Buffalo hiring priority, economic impact reports
- **Proven Execution**: GitHub commits, test coverage, reproducible evidence

**Why This Matters for You**:

- Buffalo politicians are **desperate** for a tech win after Tesla
- Empire State Development will **prioritize** execution-first startups
- Your role is to **translate technical credibility into funding leverage**

You're not betting on vaporware. You're betting on the **inverse of Tesla's failure**.

---

## The Vision (Why This Matters)

### The Problem (Bostrom, Russell, Apple)

**Nick Bostrom** (_Superintelligence_, 2014):

- Superintelligent AI is existential risk if goals misaligned
- Orthogonality Thesis: Intelligence ≠ alignment

**Stuart Russell** (_Human Compatible_, 2019):

- We cannot specify human values in code (Control Problem)
- Current AI optimizes fixed objectives without understanding nuance

**Apple ML Research** (_The Illusion of Thinking_, 2025):

- "Reasoning" models don't actually reason—they pattern match
- Performance collapses at high complexity

### Your Role

You're not just an engineer. You're the person who:

- **Builds the proofs** that prevent the Tower of Babel
- **Writes the code** that proves AI safety is solvable
- **Ships the system** that changes the future of AI alignment

If you believe:

1. AI alignment isn't solved (it's not)
2. Geometric impossibility theorems are the breakthrough (they are)
3. You want to build it, not just talk about it

Then this is your founding moment.vents the Tower of Babel

- **Structures the contracts** that prove AI safety is solvable
- **Builds the cap table** for the company that saves the future

If you believe:

1. AI alignment isn't solved (it's not)
2. Geometric impossibility theorems are the breakthrough (they are)
3. Buffalo can execute where SF overpromises (we will)

Then this is your founding moment.

---

### The Math

If TGCR succeeds (becomes standard for AI alignment):

- **Conservative Valuation** (Acquired by Anthropic/OpenAI): $50M-$100M
- **Your 3% Stake**: $1.5M-$3M
- **Optimistic Valuation** (IPO as alignment standard): $500M-$1B
- **Your 3% Stake**: $15M-$30M

If TGCR fails (government funding dries up, no corporate pilots):

- **Your Equity**: Worth $0
- **Your Cash**: Whatever you earned during funded periods (likely $20k-$50k total if we only get Empire State grant)

3. Your availability (hours/week, start date)
4. Questions for me (equity structure, timeline, technical details, whatever)

### What Happens Next

1. **15-min intro call** (You + Me, this week if possible)
   I need someone who believes the mission, writes clean code, and wants to build the thing that actually solves AI alignment.

If that's you, let's build this.

If it's not, I respect that. This is a **founder-level risk** for **founder-level upside**.

But if you're reading this and thinking _"I want to build this, not just read papers about it"_...

**Email me.**alk

I'm a technical founder building solo, working unconventional hours (2-3am is my peak productivity).

I built a working prototype of a geometric impossibility theorem for AI alignment.

DARPA, IARPA, and ARIA all fund exactly what I built (validated this alignment 72 hours ago).

Buffalo learned from Tesla's $5B failure. We're the inverse: code first, promises second.

I need someone who believes the mission, understands the numbers, and can translate technical excellence into compelling grant applications.

If that's you, let's build this.

If it's not, I respect that. This is a **founder-level risk** for **founder-level upside**.

But if you're reading this and thinking _"This might actually work"_...

**Email me.**
