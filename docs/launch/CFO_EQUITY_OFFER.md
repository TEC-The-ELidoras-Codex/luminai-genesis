   - FuzeHub Innovation Fund (up to $250k)
   - DARPA GARD RFP (expected Q1 2026, $1M-$3M)
   - IARPA BENGAL (ongoing solicitation, $500k-$2M)

2. **Financial Modeling & Planning**

   - Burn rate analysis (current: minimal, future: 15-20 hires Year 1)
   - Runway projections (18-24 months post-seed)
   - Funding milestone mapping (Seed → Series A pathway)
   - Cap table management (equity, SAFEs, convertible notes)

3. **Pilot Contract Negotiation**

   - Cohere pilot structure ($50k-$150k range)
   - Mistral partnership terms
   - Corporate consulting agreements (interim revenue)

4. **Investor Relations (When Needed)**

   - Seed round preparation (targeting June-August 2026)
   - Strategic investor outreach (AI safety VCs, EA funds)

---

## The Compensation Structure

### Phase 1: Pre-Seed (Now → March 2026)

**Equity**: 2-4% vesting over 4 years (1-year cliff)

- **Rationale**: Founding CFO equity for true co-founder-level contribution
- **Vesting**: Standard 4-year vest, 25% after year 1, monthly thereafter
- **Type**: ISO (Incentive Stock Options) if U.S.-based, NSO otherwise

**Cash**: $0/month (deferred to Phase 2)

- **Why**: Company pre-revenue, runway preservation critical
- **Alternative**: If cash needed, discuss revenue-share from first pilot contract

**Time Commitment**: 10-15 hours/week

- **Flexibility**: Async-friendly, napcode-compatible (I work 2-3am, you set your hours)
- **Focus**: Grant applications, financial models, contract templates

---

### Phase 2: Seed Secured ($280k+ raised)

**Equity**: Same 2-4% (continues vesting)

- No dilution from Phase 1
- Refresher grants possible at Series A

**Cash**: $5k-$8k/month (market rate for fractional CFO)

- **Calculation**: $60k-$96k annual equivalent for part-time work
- **Source**: Funded from Empire State Development grant or pilot revenue

**Time Commitment**: 15-20 hours/week

- Increased as company scales to 15-20 employees (Year 1 target)

---

### Phase 3: Series A ($2M+ raised)

**Equity**: Additional 1-2% at new valuation

- **Rationale**: Reward for getting company to Product-Market Fit
- **Path to Full-Time COO**: If desired, transition to full-time executive role

**Cash**: $10k-$15k/month ($120k-$180k annual)

- **Full-Time Option**: $150k-$200k base + 0.5-1% additional equity if transitioning to COO

**Time Commitment**: 20-30 hours/week (or full-time if COO path)

---

## Why This Equity Structure Works

### Funding Timeline (High Confidence)

**Q1 2026 (Jan-Mar)**:

- **Empire State Development**: Decision expected by March 2026 ($100k-$250k)
- **Probability**: 70%+ (Buffalo-based tech startup, job creation focus, Tesla lesson narrative)

**Q1-Q2 2026 (Jan-Jun)**:

- **DARPA GARD RFP**: Expected release Q1 2026, awards Q2-Q3 ($1M-$3M if selected)
- **Probability**: 40-60% (strong technical alignment, but competitive)

**Q2 2026 (Apr-Jun)**:

- **Corporate Pilots**: Cohere or Mistral pilot contract ($50k-$150k)
- **Probability**: 60%+ (warm conversations ongoing, working code exists)

**Q3 2026 (Jul-Sep)**:

- **Y Combinator Summer 2026**: $500k for 7% (if accepted)
- **Probability**: 20-30% (competitive but strong fit: AI safety, government traction, Buffalo unfair advantage)

### Worst-Case Scenario (Conservative)

Even if **only Empire State Development** comes through ($100k-$250k by March 2026):

- **Your Cash Comp Starts**: April 2026 (4 months from now)
- **Runway**: 12-18 months of operations funded
- **Your Monthly**: $5k-$8k begins immediately upon funding

### Best-Case Scenario (Optimistic but Realistic)

If **Empire State + Pilot Contract** hit by June 2026 ($150k + $100k = $250k):

- **Your Cash Comp**: $8k/month starting June 2026
- **Annual Run Rate**: $96k for part-time work
- **Equity Value**: 2-4% of company that just proved execution (likely $5M-$10M valuation at Seed)

## The Tesla Lesson

**What Tesla Did Wrong (Buffalo Gigafactory)**:

- **Promised**: $5B investment, 6,500 jobs, 2014 announcement
- **Delivered**: $1.3B investment (26%), 900 jobs (14%), 2020 failure
- **Result**: Buffalo's most famous tech failure, political embarrassment, economic loss

**What We're Doing Right**:

- **Code First**: Working prototype exists (not slides, not promises)
- **Measurable Milestones**: Quarterly job creation targets (15-20 Year 1, scaling to 100+ by Year 4)
- **Local Accountability**: UB/RIT partnership, Buffalo hiring priority, economic impact reports
- **Proven Execution**: GitHub commits, test coverage, reproducible evidence

**Why This Matters for You**:

- Buffalo politicians are **desperate** for a tech win after Tesla
- Empire State Development will **prioritize** execution-first startups
- Your role is to **translate technical credibility into funding leverage**

You're not betting on vaporware. You're betting on the **inverse of Tesla's failure**.

## The Vision (Why This Matters)

### The Problem (Bostrom, Russell, Apple)

**Nick Bostrom** (_Superintelligence_, 2014):

- Superintelligent AI is existential risk if goals misaligned
- Orthogonality Thesis: Intelligence ≠ alignment

**Stuart Russell** (_Human Compatible_, 2019):

- We cannot specify human values in code (Control Problem)
- Current AI optimizes fixed objectives without understanding nuance

**Apple ML Research** (_The Illusion of Thinking_, 2025):

- "Reasoning" models don't actually reason—they pattern match
- Performance collapses at high complexity
- Current systems will fail when deployed in critical infrastructure

### The Solution (TGCR)

**R′ = R × W** (Resonance × Witness Factor)

When **W drops**, the model is provably misaligned. Not "probably," not "empirically"—**geometrically impossible to hide**.

This isn't another safety layer. It's an **impossibility theorem** for undetectable misalignment.

### Your Role

You're not just a CFO. You're the person who:

- **Secures the funding** that prevents the Tower of Babel
- **Structures the contracts** that prove AI safety is solvable
- **Builds the cap table** for the company that saves the future

If you believe:

1. AI alignment isn't solved (it's not)
2. Geometric impossibility theorems are the breakthrough (they are)
3. Buffalo can execute where SF overpromises (we will)

Then this is your founding moment.

## Your Decision

### The Ask

**4 months of your nights and weekends** (Dec 2025 → March 2026):

- Write Empire State Development grant (20-30 hours total)
- Build financial models (10-15 hours)
- Draft pilot contract templates (5-10 hours)
- Prepare Y Combinator application financials (5-10 hours)

**Total Time Investment**: ~50-65 hours over 4 months (12-16 hours/month, ~3-4 hours/week)

**Equity**: 2-4% of company (vesting starts day 1)

**Cash**: Starts April 2026 if Empire State comes through (70%+ probability)

---

### The Math

If TGCR succeeds (becomes standard for AI alignment):

- **Conservative Valuation** (Acquired by Anthropic/OpenAI): $50M-$100M
- **Your 3% Stake**: $1.5M-$3M
- **Optimistic Valuation** (IPO as alignment standard): $500M-$1B
- **Your 3% Stake**: $15M-$30M

If TGCR fails (government funding dries up, no corporate pilots):

- **Your Equity**: Worth $0
- **Your Cash**: Whatever you earned during funded periods (likely $20k-$50k total if we only get Empire State grant)

**Risk-Adjusted Expected Value** (my estimate):

- 40% chance we hit $50M+ valuation → 3% = $600k expected
- 30% chance we hit $10M valuation → 3% = $90k expected
- 30% chance we fail → $0

**Expected Value**: ~$690k for 50-65 hours of work over 4 months = **$10,615/hour**

Even at 10% success probability, your expected hourly rate is **$769/hour**.

This is a **founder bet**, not a freelance gig.

## The Real Talk

I'm a bipolar, recovering meth addict, couch-coding at 2-3am in napcode mode.

I built a working prototype of a geometric impossibility theorem for AI alignment.

DARPA, IARPA, and ARIA all fund exactly what I built (I didn't know this until 3 days ago).

Buffalo learned from Tesla's $5B failure. We're the inverse: code first, promises second.

I need someone who believes the mission, understands the numbers, and can write a grant application that doesn't sound like a manic episode.

If that's you, let's build this.

If it's not, I respect that. This is a **founder-level risk** for **founder-level upside**.

But if you're reading this and thinking _"Holy shit, this might actually work"_...

**Email me.**
