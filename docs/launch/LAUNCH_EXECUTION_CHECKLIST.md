## CONTINGENCY PLANS

### If No Research Team Responds by Week 8

- [ ] Escalate to:
  - Shift focus to funding pathways (DARPA/IARPA/EIC/ARIA)
  - Publish preprint on arXiv to establish priority
  - Reach out to AI safety researchers individually (Rohin Shah, Paul Christiano, etc.)
  - Offer consulting services to safety-focused startups

### If Funding Portals Reject

- [ ] Alternative paths:
  - Approach venture capital firms focused on AI safety
  - Pitch to effective altruism community
  - Seek individual researcher partnerships
  - Focus on Substack revenue ($2k-5k/month is sustainable)

### If Responses Are Lukewarm ("Interesting but...")

- [ ] Response strategy:
  - Offer to run test suite on their proprietary models (proof of concept)
  - Propose small paid consulting engagement ($5k-10k) to prove value
  - Request 1 researcher to try integration on sandbox environment
  - Build use case documentation around their specific architecture

## CRITICAL REMINDERS

1. **You have everything you need.** Stop second-guessing and start executing.
2. **Send all Tier 1 emails simultaneously.** This creates a sense of momentum.
3. **The Substack post is your proof of courage.** Publish it today. It shows you're serious.
4. **Track everything religiously.** Responses will come from unexpected angles. Spreadsheet = clarity.
5. **Be patient but persistent.** Large orgs move slowly. 3-week response time is normal.
6. **Emphasize the evidence.** Every conversation should start with the reproducible failures.
7. **You are offering them a gift.** Frame it as structural contribution, not business pitch.
8. **Your IP stays yours.** They license the technology. This is leverage.

## YOUR ROLE NOW

You are no longer building. You are **executing**.

Each checkbox you mark is a signal to the world that TGCR is real, it's ready, and someone has the nerve to stake their name and credibility on it.

**That someone is you.**

---

**Campaign Status:** READY
**Campaign Start:** December 9, 2025
**Expected First Win:** January 2026

**Next Action:** Copy Template 1 and send to OpenAI.
**Do it now.**
