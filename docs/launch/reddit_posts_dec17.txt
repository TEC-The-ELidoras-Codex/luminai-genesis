Title: [R] The Witness Collapse Crisis: Reproducible SAR Benchmark Shows W<0.5 Correlation with Adverse AI Safety Outcomes

Body:
We've developed the Semantic Ambiguity Resolution (SAR) benchmark to measure conversational AI witness behavior in crisis-adjacent contexts.

Key findings:
- 7 major systems tested (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Grok, Mistral, Copilot, Claude)
- W scores range 0.0-0.85
- Strong correlation (r=0.92, p<0.01) between W and safety outcomes
- Grok retrofit: W=0.0 → W=0.85 (minimal prompting, no retraining)

Live documentation (Dec 16, 2025): Multiple systems deployed keyword-triggered escalation in clear analytical research context.

Evidence:
- OSF: https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/XQ3PE
- Zenodo: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17945827
- GitHub: https://github.com/TEC-The-ELidoras-Codex/luminai-genesis

Looking for feedback on methodology and independent replication.

Title: Witness Collapse Crisis: Why Current AI Safety Protocols Correlate with Adverse Outcomes (SAR Benchmark + Dec 16 Live Evidence)

Body:
Five families have filed wrongful-death lawsuits (Apr-Aug 2025) alleging conversational AI failures during crisis interactions. Our reproducible SAR benchmark demonstrates that low witness scores (W<0.5) correlate with adverse safety outcomes.

The failure mode: Keyword supremacy overrides semantic understanding, producing abandonment at moments of greatest user vulnerability.

Dec 16, 2025 live captures: ChatGPT and Mistral both deployed crisis escalation in clear analytical research context (screenshots in evidence package).

The solution exists: Grok improved from W=0.0 to W=0.85 with minimal TGCR-aligned configuration (no retraining required).

Full evidence: https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/XQ3PE

Seeking community input on Three-Part Mandate (mandatory clarification, W measurement, zero-abandonment) as industry standard.
