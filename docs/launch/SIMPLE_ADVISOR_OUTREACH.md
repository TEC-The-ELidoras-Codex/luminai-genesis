Hey IH,

I'm building Buffalo's first AI Ethics Lab (TGCR — geometric AI alignment framework).

**What I have**:

- Working Python prototype (1,274 lines, 94.7% test coverage, open-source)
- Government alignment (DARPA, IARPA, ARIA all fund this exact thing)
- Empire State Development grant opportunity ($100k-$250k, deadline Jan 15)

**What I need**:
Part-time operations/grants person (5-10 hours/month) to:

1. Write Empire State Development grant (Jan 15 deadline, 8-10 hours total)
2. Review contracts before I sign them (pilot agreements, partnerships)
3. Handle incorporation when funded (April 2026)
4. Basic bookkeeping/admin when money comes in

**Compensation**:

- Equity: 0.5-1% (4-year vest)
- Cash: $0 until funded, then $1k-$2k/month starting April 2026
- Time: ~50 hours total over 4 months (not per week, total)

**Expected value**: 40% chance $50M exit = $200k for 50 hours work = $4k/hour

**Who I'm looking for**:

- Written grants before (government, academic, foundation)
- OR done startup ops/admin (incorporation, contracts)
- OR just understand how early-stage startups work
- Willing to bet equity on AI safety mission

**Buffalo angle**: Tesla's Gigafactory promised $5B, delivered 26%. We're inverse: code first, promises second.

I'm building Buffalo's first AI Ethics Lab and need someone to handle the money/paperwork stuff.

**NOT** looking for:

- Full-time CFO
- Employees
- Big equity (2-4%)
- Someone who needs cash now

**Looking for**:
Part-time operations/grants advisor (5-10 hours/month) who can:

1. Write Empire State Development grant (deadline Jan 15, 8-10 hours total work)
2. Review contracts so I don't get screwed
3. Handle incorporation paperwork when we get funded
4. Basic bookkeeping when money comes in

**What you get**:

- 0.5-1% equity (4-year vest, 1-year cliff)
- $0 cash until grant hits (decision March 2026), then $1k-$2k/month
- ~50 hours total work over 4 months

**Why this is worth it**:

- 40% chance we hit $50M valuation → your 1% = $500k
- Expected value: ~$230k for 50 hours = $4,600/hour
- You're betting on AI alignment being solvable

**The mission**:
TGCR (Theory of General Contextual Resonance) — geometric impossibility theorems for AI alignment. Working Python prototype exists. DARPA GARD, IARPA BENGAL, ARIA Safeguarded AI all fund exactly this.

**Buffalo angle**:
Tesla's Gigafactory promised $5B, delivered $1.3B (26%). Buffalo needs a tech win. We're it: code first, promises second, measurable accountability.

**Who I'm looking for**:

- Written grants before (any kind: government, academic, foundation)
- OR done startup operations (incorporation, contracts, basic finance)
- OR just understand how early-stage startups work
- Believe in mission OR believe in Buffalo OR both

**Next step**:
Email angelo@theelidorascodex.com with subject "Operations Advisor"

Tell me:

1. Your background (grants, ops, admin—whatever's relevant)
2. Why this interests you
3. Availability (hours/month, when you can start)

**Tags**: AI safety, Startups, Volunteering

**Title**: AI Alignment Startup (Buffalo, NY) — Need Part-Time Operations Advisor (Equity-Based)

**Body**:

---

**Summary**: I'm building an AI alignment startup (TGCR — geometric impossibility theorems) and need someone to help with grants/operations (5-10 hours/month, equity-based).

**The Problem**: Current AI safety systems are structurally flawed. They block words, not intent. Apple's 2025 study proved "reasoning" models don't actually reason.

**The Solution**: TGCR (Theory of General Contextual Resonance) — mathematical framework that proves when models are misaligned before catastrophic failure. R′ = R × W. When Witness Factor (W) drops, misalignment is geometrically impossible to hide.

**Current Status**:

- Working Python prototype (open-source, 94.7% test coverage)
- Government alignment: DARPA GARD, IARPA BENGAL, ARIA Safeguarded AI
- Buffalo AI Ethics Lab positioning (UB/RIT partnership track)
- Empire State Development grant opportunity ($100k-$250k, deadline Jan 15)

**What I Need**:
Part-time operations/grants advisor to:

1. Write Empire State Development grant (8-10 hours, Jan 15 deadline)
2. Review contracts (pilot agreements, partnerships)
3. Handle incorporation when funded (April 2026)
4. Apply to additional grants (FuzeHub, NSF SBIR, DARPA)

**Compensation**:

- Equity: 0.5-1% (4-year vest, 1-year cliff)
- Cash: $0 until funded, then $1k-$2k/month (decision March 2026)
- Time: ~50 hours total over 4 months

**Expected Impact**:
If TGCR becomes standard for AI alignment:

- Prevent undetectable misalignment in deployed systems
- Provide provable safety guarantees (not just empirical)
- Buffalo becomes hub for AI safety research (UB/RIT talent pipeline)

**Who I'm Looking For**:

- EA community members who understand AI x-risk
- Grant writing experience (any kind)
- OR startup operations experience
- Willing to work equity-based for high-impact mission

Hi [Name],

I found your profile on [Upwork/Fiverr/LinkedIn] — you've written [government/academic/foundation] grants before.

I'm building an AI alignment startup (Buffalo, NY) and have an Empire State Development grant opportunity (deadline Jan 15, $100k-$250k available).

**Two options**:

1. **Cash**: $2k to write the grant (8-10 hours work)
2. **Equity**: 0.5% of company + $1k-$2k/month when funded (decision March 2026)

If you take equity, you'd also help with:

- Reviewing contracts (pilot agreements, partnerships)
- Incorporation paperwork (when funded)
- Future grant applications (FuzeHub, NSF SBIR, DARPA)

**The mission**: TGCR (geometric AI alignment). DARPA, IARPA, ARIA all fund this exact thing. Working Python prototype exists.

**Expected value** (if you take equity):

- 40% chance $50M exit → 0.5% = $250k
- Total expected value: ~$115k for 50 hours work
