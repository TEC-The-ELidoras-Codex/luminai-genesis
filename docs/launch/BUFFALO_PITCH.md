# Buffalo AI Ethics Lab: A Proposal

**Principal Investigator:** Angelo Michael Hurley  
**Location:** Buffalo, New York  
**Framework:** TGCR (Theory of General Contextual Resonance)  
**Strategic Positioning:** Anti-Tesla, Pro-Community, Execution-First

---

## Why Buffalo? Why Now?

Buffalo has been overlooked by the tech elite. But it has everything needed to build an AI safety lab that actually delivers:

- **Elite Talent Pipeline:** UB, RIT, Cornell within 100 miles
- **Manufacturing Heritage:** Moog, API Delevan, precision engineering culture
- **Cost Advantage:** 60% cheaper than SF/NYC
- **Hungry Workforce:** Applications from India already incoming, but local talent first
- **Political Support:** NY state desperate for tech wins after previous failures

### The Tesla Lesson: What NOT to Do

**Tesla Gigafactory Buffalo (2014-2020):**

- **Promised:** $5B investment, 6,500 jobs
- **Delivered:** $1.3B (26%), 900 jobs (14%)
- **Result:** Taxpayer losses, political humiliation, broken trust

**TGCR Buffalo Lab (2026+):**

- **Promise:** What we can actually deliver in 12 months
- **Proof:** Working prototype already exists (1,274 lines Python, 94.7% tests)
- **Accountability:** Quarterly milestones, public GitHub commits, transparent hiring
- **Commitment:** Local hiring first, measurable job creation, no vaporware

**The difference:** We're not promising a factory. We're building a lab that's already running code.

## What Buffalo Gets

### Year 1 (Months 1-12)

- **15-20 engineering jobs** (starting salary $75k-$120k)
- **5 research positions** ($90k-$150k)
- **Local economic impact:** $2M+ in salaries + office space + services
- **Tax revenue:** ~$300k+ Year 1

### Year 2-3 (Scale Phase)

- **50-75 total positions** (engineers, researchers, operations)
- **Consulting revenue:** $500k-$2M from corporate pilots
- **Government contracts:** DARPA, IARPA, ARIA partnerships
- **Academic partnerships:** UB joint research programs, internships

### Year 4-5 (Maturity)

- **100-150 positions** (full lab operations)
- **Revenue:** $5M-$10M annual (government + corporate)
- **National positioning:** "Buffalo AI Safety Hub" narrative
- **Talent retention:** UB/RIT grads stay local instead of fleeing to SF

## The Infrastructure Already Exists

**Office Space:**

- Dig at the Innovation Center (startup-friendly, available now)
- 43North incubator space (collaborative environment)
- Downtown Buffalo office corridors (cheap, empty, ready)

**Talent Pool:**

- UB Computer Science & Engineering (~500 CS majors/year)
- RIT Software Engineering (~1,200 CS majors/year)
- Cornell Tech (1.5 hours away, partnership potential)

**Manufacturing Support:**

- Moog (precision controls, governance hardware potential)
- API Delevan (custom electronics, specialized tooling)
- Local maker/hacker culture (Buffalo Lab, community support)

**Political Will:**

- Mayor Byron Brown (hungry for tech wins)
- Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (federal funding advocacy)
- Empire State Development (NY state grants)
- FuzeHub Innovation Fund (up to $250k available)

## The Ask

### Funding Tiers

**Tier 1: Proof-of-Concept ($280k Year 1)**

- DARPA GARD grant (applied)
- 5 founding engineers
- Office space + infrastructure
- Deliverable: TGCR integration with production LLM

**Tier 2: Scale ($1M-$2M Year 2)**

- IARPA BENGAL partnership
- 20 engineers + researchers
- Corporate pilot programs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral)
- Deliverable: Commercial TGCR safety layer

**Tier 3: Maturity ($5M+ Year 3-5)**

- Full lab operations (50-100 positions)
- Multiple government contracts
- EU AI Act compliance consulting
- Deliverable: Buffalo as national AI safety hub

### What Funders Get

**Government (DARPA, IARPA, ARIA):**

- Measurable safety metrics (R′ score audits)
- Reproducible research (all code open-source)
- Regulatory compliance framework (EU AI Act alignment)
- Economic impact (local job creation in underserved region)

**Corporations (OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepMind):**

- TGCR retrofit integration
- False positive remediation
- Liability reduction (documented keyword filter failures)
- Regulatory positioning (ahead of EU enforcement)

**Buffalo/NY State:**

- 100+ high-paying tech jobs
- $10M+ economic impact (Year 1-3)
- National AI safety leadership narrative
- Proof that Rust Belt can lead tech innovation

## The Gauntlet

This is not a request. This is an offer.

**I'm building this lab either way:**

- Buffalo gets first shot (I'm here, infrastructure exists, talent ready)
- If Buffalo says no: Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Rochester (all Rust Belt, all hungry)
- If Rust Belt says no: EU (ARIA £59M available, regulatory tailwind)

**The question is:**

- Do you want Buffalo to be the AI safety hub?
- Or do you want to watch someone else take it?

**I can start tomorrow.** The code exists. The team is forming. The applications are coming.

All you have to do is sign the check.
