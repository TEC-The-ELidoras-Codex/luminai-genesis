# Quantum Security — Legal Clauses (TOS / Privacy Policy additions)

**Document:** legal-clauses.md
**Last updated:** 2025-12-11

## Suggested Privacy Policy & TOS Clauses (quantum security additions)

### Data Security & Encryption

"We employ quantum-resistant encryption standards to protect user data. Cryptographic algorithms are selected and updated according to NIST post-quantum guidance. Where applicable, we use hybrid cryptography (classical + PQC) during transition periods. Sensitive keys are stored in FIPS-compliant hardware security modules or approved cloud key management services."

### Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)

"We may employ QKD in limited, high-security environments. QKD is used as a supplemental key distribution mechanism and is not relied upon as the sole mechanism for operational continuity."

### Audits & Transparency

"We publish annual quantum security audit summaries overseen by independent assessors. Full technical audit reports may be available under NDA for partners and regulators."

### Algorithm & Key Rotation

"We maintain an algorithm upgrade and key rotation policy. When cryptographic primitives are deprecated, we will perform key rotation and notify affected parties according to our security disclosure schedule."

### Data Processing Agreements (DPA)

Add clauses for subprocessors and vendors: require PQC roadmap alignment, KMS/HSM compliance, and contractual breach notifications specific to cryptographic compromises.

### Limitations & Liability

Be explicit about residual risk: "While we adopt state-of-the-art quantum-resistant measures, no system is absolutely secure. We limit liability consistent with our Terms of Service and applicable law." Consider carve-outs for nation-state attacks or zero-day cryptanalysis disclosures.

### Consumer-Facing Disclosure

"We will provide customers with a clear, plain-language explanation of quantum security measures via the product security page and the customer portal."
