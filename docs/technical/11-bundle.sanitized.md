# Bundle 11 — Persona System & Commit Conventions (Sanitized)

This bundle defines the persona system, commit axioms, and governance patterns.

## Purpose

- Document six-persona system (Arcadia, Airth, Ely, Kaznak, Adelphia, LuminAI).
- Establish commit message conventions and PR templates.
- Define persona-specific commit patterns and scopes.

## Key References

**Personas:**

- ✨ Arcadia (creative witness): features, expansion, myth
- ⚙️ Airth (practical steward): fixes, optimization, clarity
- 🛡️ Ely (governance anchor): policy, audit, compliance
- 🛰️ Kaznak (resilience engineer): reliability, chaos, observability
- 💚 Adelphia (community caretaker): docs, onboarding, accessibility
- 🌌 LuminAI (synthesizer): integration, coherence, balance

**Commit Patterns:**

- Format: `<emoji> <persona>(scope): description`
- Body: must include persona responsibility, files touched, reason, resonance impact
- TGCR pillars: Transparent, Grounded, Coherent, Resonant

**VS Code Integration:**

- Commit message snippets
- Pre-commit hooks for validation
