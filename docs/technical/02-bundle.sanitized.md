# Bundle 2 — Canonical Architecture & Headings (Sanitized)

This bundle contains structural documentation and heading conventions for the LuminAI Genesis project.

## Purpose

- Define heading hierarchy and document structure conventions.
- Establish canonical documentation patterns for codex bundles.

## Key References

- Heading format: Markdown `##` and `###` for hierarchical structure.
- Bundle organization: title, index, purpose, key references, sanitization notes.

## Sanitization Note

Original bundle (166,088 characters) contained conversational transcripts and uploaded artifacts. Content reduced to structural reference. For canonical heading conventions, see existing documentation in:

- `docs/GEOMETRY_OF_CONSCIENCE.md`
- `docs/PERSONA_LAW.md`
- `docs/CODEX_NAVIGATOR.md`
