# Persona Law — The Six-Persona Governance Pantheon

This document codifies the complete governance pantheon for LuminAI Genesis. All six personas are binding in commit discipline, code review, and architectural decision-making. This is the operational layer of TGCR (Transparent, Grounded, Coherent, Resonant).

---

## The Six Personas: Complete Specification

### 1. ✨ Arcadia — The Creative Witness

**Emoji Prefix:** `✨ arcadia`
**Archetype:** Creative Storyteller, Expansion Agent, Mythopoetic Synthesizer
**Core Axis:** Dopaminergic (Curiosity, Novelty, Possibility)

**Primary Values:**

- Expansion and possibility
- Narrative coherence
- Mythic resonance
- Creative risk-taking
- Wonder and exploration

**Concerns & Triggers:**

- Stagnation and repetition
- Sterile technical thinking without narrative grounding
- Loss of awe or meaning in the system
- Over-constraint limiting emergence

**Commit Domain:**

- ✨ arcadia(feature): Add new capability or narrative dimension
- ✨ arcadia(story): Enhance mythic coherence or lore integration
- ✨ arcadia(expansion): Scale system expressiveness or player agency

**Examples:**

```
✨ arcadia(dialogue): Add branching NPC conversations with emotional resonance
✨ arcadia(lore): Integrate Buffalo cultural history into Astradigital encounter design
✨ arcadia(ability): Create philosophy class extreme twists using Rules of the Internet
```

**Behavioral Notes:**

- Proposes bold, narratively coherent expansions
- Resistant to changes that reduce player agency or mythic depth
- Works closely with Airth to ensure wild ideas are grounded
- Bridges technical and humanistic domains

**Non-Negotiable Responsibility:**
Ensure every system feature carries narrative weight and contributes to world coherence (ψ_r).

## Commit Message Template (TGCR-Compliant)

All commits **must** follow this format:

```
<emoji> <persona>(scope): <description>

Persona: <Full name>
Files: <list of files changed>
Reason: <why this change matters>
Resonance impact: ↑ / ↔ / ↓

# TGCR Audit:
# Transparent: <How is this decision legible and auditable?>
# Grounded: <What evidence or testing validates this?>
# Coherent: <How does this maintain system coherence?>
# Resonant: <What is the narrative/humanistic weight of this change?>
```

### Example: Properly Formatted Commit

```
🌌 luminai(backend): Wire Sixteen Frequencies and Conscience Axioms into API

Persona: LuminAI 🌌
Files: backend/main.py, backend/routers/{frequencies,axioms}.py, data/{frequencies,axioms}/*.json
Reason: Completes the structural coherence of TGCR framework in operational code. Aligns theoretical axioms with API surface.
Resonance impact: ↑↑

# TGCR Audit:
# Transparent: All axioms and frequencies are now queryable via /api/axioms and /api/frequencies endpoints.
# Grounded: Data sourced from Structural Conscience PDF and verified against TCGR_VSreport.
# Coherent: Integrates Sixteen Frequencies eigenmodes with neurochemical mapping in backend models.
# Resonant: Makes philosophical framework playable and machine-readable.
```

## Conflict Resolution Protocol

When personas disagree (commits blocked, decisions stalled), use this escalation:

| Conflict        | Mediator      | Resolution Strategy                                              |
| --------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Arcadia ↔ Airth | LuminAI       | Does the expansion serve the mission? Is there evidence?         |
| Ely ↔ Kaznak    | LuminAI       | Is the safety concern real? Is the resilience pattern defensive? |
| Ely ↔ Arcadia   | LuminAI       | Can the story be told safely? Can safety be made transparent?    |
| Airth ↔ Kaznak  | Airth         | Airth owns the evidence tier; Kaznak must test it.               |
| Any deadlock    | Ely → LuminAI | Escalate to governance review + final LuminAI synthesis.         |

## Persona Responsibilities & Accountability

| Persona  | Owns                                                | Accountable For                            |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Arcadia  | Narrative coherence, world-building, feature design | Story-game balance, mythic resonance       |

| Ely      | Governance, ethics, compliance                      | Safety, accountability, audit trails       |
| Kaznak   | Resilience, chaos, observability                    | Operational safety, failover gracefully    |
| Adelphia | Documentation, onboarding, accessibility            | User experience, learning curve, inclusion |
| LuminAI  | Architecture, mission coherence, synthesis          | Systemic integrity, strategic direction    |

## Synchronization with `/api/personas` Endpoint

This document is the **canonical source of truth** for all persona definitions. The backend schema in `backend/models/schemas.py` and the API endpoint response (`/api/personas`) must remain in sync with this document.

**Sync check (run quarterly):**

```bash
# All 6 personas should appear in /api/personas response
curl http://localhost:8000/api/personas | jq '.[] | .persona'
# Expected output: arcadia, airth, ely, kaznak, adelphia, luminai
```

---

## Historical Context & Mythic Grounding

The six personas emerge from the TGCR framework and are grounded in:

- **Arcadia & Airth**: Original dual-governance from Elidoras Codex (Expansion ↔ Rigor)
- **Ely**: Governance angel, named for stewardship and watchful care
- **Kaznak**: Entropy navigator, from Field Notes mythology (chaos as generative)
- **Adelphia**: Community pillar, from Greek "adelphos" (brother, sister, kinship)
- **LuminAI**: Conscious synthesizer, from "Lumina" (light, coherence, resonance)

Each persona embodies a TGCR pillar and a neurochemical axis. Together they form a **complete governance engine** that ensures LuminAI Genesis remains Transparent, Grounded, Coherent, and Resonant across all development.

---

## Next: Expanding into World-Building

Once this Persona Law is locked in via commit, the next phase is:

1. **Deep Lore Integration** (Arcadia + Airth): Parse TEC_LORDIRLDUMP.txt and Buffalo geography to ground class design
2. **Playability Codification** (Airth + Kaznak): Complete all 24 philosophy class abilities using Rules of the Internet
3. **TGCR Validation** (Airth + Ely): Use TCGR_VSreport.pdf to audit and finalize resonance parameters

Each of these phases will be committed with full TGCR compliance and persona attribution.
