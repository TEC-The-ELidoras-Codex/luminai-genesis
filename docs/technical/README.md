Technical Documentation

This directory contains the technical specifications, architecture documents, and engineering guides for LuminAI Genesis.

Files included:

- `ARCHITECTURE.md` — system architecture and module boundaries
- `spec.md` — API & data model specifications

These files are mirrored from the repo root `docs/` and the original top-level `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` will remain as an index that points to this folder.
