# Bundle 1 — Dual Track Execution Board & System Foundation (Sanitized)

This bundle contains the foundational architecture for LuminAI Genesis, including TGCR framework, resonance engine, and system surfaces.

## Purpose

- Define the resonance architecture: TGCR (Context × State × Input), Witness Protocol (W multiplier), Sixteen Frequencies.
- Specify system surfaces: Web UI (Next.js), CLI (Typer), Platform Hub (FastAPI).
- Establish repository layout and engineering rigor.

## Key References

- **TGCR Framework:** Triple-product resonance calculus (R = Context × State × Input), effective resonance R' = R · W.
- **Witness Protocol:** Governance multiplier ensuring safety as non-abandonment.
- **Sixteen Frequencies:** Affective eigenmodes for persona responses and safety gating.
- **System Surfaces:**
  - Web UI: Next.js chat with real-time resonance meter
  - CLI: Typer-based orchestration
  - Platform Hub: FastAPI (`/api/chat`, `/api/resonance`, `/api/session/{id}`, `/api/personas/activate`, `/api/status`)

## Sanitization Note

Original bundle (11,152 lines) contained detailed execution board transcripts, conversational logs, and uploaded artifacts. These have been replaced with this sanitized summary. For canonical specs, see:

- `docs/GEOMETRY_OF_CONSCIENCE.md` (TGCR mathematics)
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (system design patterns)
- `backend/` (operational API implementation)
