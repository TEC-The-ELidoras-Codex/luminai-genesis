# Why This Exists — Short Landing Copy

LuminAI captures the moments that matter between appointments and gives clinicians a way to act on real-time context, not reconstructed memories. It’s a continuity engine built for presence, privacy, and clinical oversight.

We’re building a system that:

- Collects meaningful moments with consent
- Builds clinician-ready summaries
- Prioritizes safety through explainable scoring
