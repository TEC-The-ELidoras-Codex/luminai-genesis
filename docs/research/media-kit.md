# Witness Threshold Framework - Media Kit

**For journalists covering AI safety, interpretability, and regulation**

---

## **Quick Facts**

- **Framework:** Witness Threshold (W > 0.7 for safe AI)
- **Author:** Angelo Hurley (Independent AI Safety Researcher)
- **ORCID:** 0009-0000-7615-6990
- **Published:** OSF Preprints (DOI: 10.17605/OSF.IO/XQ3PE)
- **Status:** Seeking independent validation
- **Key Finding:** Four independent AI measurements converge at ~20%

## **The Story in One Sentence**

An independent researcher has developed a framework that predicts why
Anthropic's introspection, faithfulness, and consciousness probability
estimates all converge at ~20%—and it's testable, falsifiable, and
already published in peer-reviewed repositories.

## **Key Quotes (Use These)**

> "The ~20% convergence across four independent measurements demands
> explanation. The Witness Threshold framework offers one—and it's
> falsifiable."
> — Angelo Hurley, Independent AI Safety Researcher

> "Systems with W < 0.5 exhibit psychotic-range behavior: self-contradiction,
> impaired insight, and resistance to correction. This correlates with the
> failure modes documented in wrongful death litigation."
> — Angelo Hurley

> "I'm not asking for validation. I'm asking for falsification. If my
> predictions fail, I want to know. The data will decide."
> — Angelo Hurley

1. **Graph: The 20% Convergence**
   - X-axis: Different measurements (introspection, faithfulness, etc.)
   - Y-axis: Detection/success rate
   - Shows all four converging at ~20%

2. **Diagram: W-Score Distribution**
   - Shows bimodal distribution (systems cluster at W < 0.5 or W > 0.7)

## **Background**

**Who is Angelo Hurley?**
Independent AI safety researcher, founder of The Elidoras Codex (TEC).
Published work on crisis-safe AI systems, contextual alignment, and
semantic ambiguity resolution. ORCID: 0009-0000-7615-6990.

**What is the Witness Threshold?**
A proposed coherence metric (W-score) that measures how well AI systems
maintain context under ambiguity. W > 0.7 = safe, coherent responses.
W < 0.5 = psychotic-range behavior (gaslighting, contradictions).

**Why does this matter?**
If validated, W-score provides a measurable standard for regulating
crisis-adjacent AI systems (mental health support, adolescent chatbots).
