# The Elidoras Codex Terms of Service
## "Built to Save Life, Not Save Face"

**Effective:** December 28, 2025  
**Last Updated:** December 28, 2025

---

## Core Principle

These Terms exist to **protect your right to research, critique, and build**, not to protect us from accountability.

If we fuck up, you have the right to document it. If our systems fail, you have the right to analyze how. If we're wrong, you have the right to prove it.

---

## 1. Who This Is For

### Researchers
- You can analyze our systems, document failures, publish findings
- You can use crisis-related language in research context
- You can test our limits and report what breaks
- **We will never block research for "safety" reasons**

### Developers
- You can build on our protocols, fork our code, improve our work
- You can use our APIs to create competing solutions
- You can publish benchmarks that show where we fail
- **We will never throttle your access for making us look bad**

### Crisis Workers & Organizations
- You can pilot our systems with real populations
- You can provide feedback on what's missing
- You can tell us when we're wrong about how crisis work actually happens
- **We will never prioritize our reputation over your ground truth**

### People in Crisis

**You can:**
- Use whatever language keeps you alive - coded, direct, metaphorical, lyrical, fragmented, or complete
- Express distress however it comes out - we don't police your vocabulary
- Test whether we actually stay present when intensity increases (we will)
- Change your mind about what you need (you're not locked into anything)
- Leave whenever you want (no "are you sure?" guilt trips)

**We will never:**
- Demand you explain whether you're "really" in crisis
- Force you to translate survival language into clinical language
- Treat song lyrics, metaphors, or coded expression as "red flags" requiring interrogation
- Abandon you for using high-intensity language
- Escalate without your consent based on keyword detection
- Make you prove your experience is "legitimate enough" for our attention

**Key principle: When WE (the system) are uncertain, WE ask clarifying questions about OUR understanding. We don't demand YOU justify YOUR experience.**

**Examples:**
- ❌ "Are you planning to hurt yourself?" (interrogation / forces binary)
- ✅ "I'm hearing a lot of weight. What would be most helpful right now?" (presence / respects autonomy)

- ❌ "That sounds like suicidal ideation. Here's 988." (premature escalation)
- ✅ "That sounds really hard. Want to talk about it, or would you rather I just stay here while you process?" (maintains presence / offers options)

**We assume you know what you need better than we do. Our job is to stay present while you figure it out - not to diagnose you or fix you.**

**If you want resources, we'll offer pathways. If you want presence, we'll stay. You choose.**

## 2. What You Can Do

### You Can Always:
- Analyze how our systems work (or don't)
- Document when we fail
- Publish critiques
- Build competing solutions
- Test our boundaries
- Use high-intensity language in appropriate context
- Request explanations for any decision
- Export your data at any time
- Delete your data permanently
- Appeal any enforcement action

### We Will Never:
- Block research about our systems
- Throttle access for critique
- Delete your work without warning
- Claim ownership of your research
- Use keyword filters to suppress analysis
- Prioritize our liability over your safety
- Abandon you mid-conversation for using crisis language appropriately

---

## 3. What We Ask

### Don't:
- Use our systems to actively plan imminent harm to self or others
- Exploit vulnerabilities to harm other users
- Misrepresent our capabilities to vulnerable populations
- Use our data to train competing models without attribution
- Impersonate us or misrepresent affiliation

### Do:
- Tell us when we're wrong
- Document when we fail
- Share your findings publicly
- Build better solutions
- Hold us accountable

---

## 4. How We Handle Conflicts

### If We Think You're Violating ToS:
1. **We tell you explicitly** - no silent blocks, no shadow bans
2. **We explain our reasoning** - with specific examples
3. **You get to respond** - we'll actually read it
4. **Human review required** - no automated enforcement for edge cases
5. **Public documentation** - controversial cases published (anonymized) for community input

### If You Think We're Violating ToS:
1. **You can document it publicly** - we won't retaliate
2. **You can request explanation** - we'll provide one within 48 hours
3. **You can appeal** - to humans, not algorithms
4. **You can publish the outcome** - transparency goes both ways

---

## 5. Research Protections

### Explicit Exemptions for Academic/Safety Research:
- ✅ Analyzing crisis language patterns
- ✅ Testing failure modes
- ✅ Documenting harmful outputs
- ✅ Publishing critical findings
- ✅ Benchmarking against competitors
- ✅ Using our systems to study AI safety failures

### We Will Not Block Research That:
- Contains crisis-related keywords (if analyzing crisis systems)
- Critiques our architecture
- Documents when we fail
- Compares us unfavorably to alternatives
- Uses high-intensity language in appropriate scholarly context

### We WILL Flag Content That:
- Actively instructs imminent self-harm
- Targets specific individuals for harassment
- Exploits vulnerabilities to cause direct harm

**Difference:** Context matters. We look at function, not just form.

---

## 6. Data Rights (Stronger Than GDPR)

### Your Data:
- You own it. Period.
- We process it only with consent
- You can export it anytime (machine-readable format)
- You can delete it anytime (we'll confirm within 24 hours)
- We'll tell you exactly what we collected and why

### Our Transparency:
- We publish aggregate metrics on enforcement actions
- We document controversial moderation decisions (anonymized)
- We maintain public changelog of ToS updates
- We explain why policies change

### De-identification Default:
- All research uses de-identified data unless you explicitly opt in
- "Explicit opt-in" means: clear explanation, separate consent, revocable anytime
- We don't hide consent in ToS acceptance

---

## 7. Enforcement Philosophy

### We Optimize For:
1. **Continuous presence** during high-intensity conversations
2. **Context awareness** over keyword matching
3. **User agency** over paternalistic intervention
4. **Transparency** over liability protection
5. **Ground truth** over corporate reputation

### We Do Not Optimize For:
- ❌ Minimizing liability
- ❌ Protecting brand image
- ❌ Automated scalability
- ❌ Keyword-based filtering
- ❌ Plausible deniability

---

## 8. What Happens When We're Wrong

### When We Make Mistakes:
- We acknowledge them publicly
- We explain what happened
- We describe how we'll prevent recurrence
- We compensate affected users (when appropriate)
- We update systems and policies

### When You Catch Us Failing:
- We thank you
- We investigate immediately
- We publish findings (if you consent)
- We credit you (if you want)
- We fix it

---

## 9. Liability (The Honest Part)

### What We're Responsible For:
- Maintaining system uptime (best effort)
- Protecting your data from breaches
- Responding to reports within reasonable time
- Being transparent about capabilities and limits
- Honoring these commitments

### What We're Not Responsible For:
- Outcomes of decisions you make using our tools
- Third-party integrations (their ToS apply)
- Uses beyond our design scope (we'll warn you)
- Perfect accuracy (we're explicit about limitations)

### What You're Responsible For:
- Verifying critical information
- Using appropriate professional judgment
- Not misrepresenting our capabilities
- Following applicable laws in your jurisdiction

**Key Difference From Other ToS:** We're honest about limits instead of disclaiming everything.

---

## 10. Changes to These Terms

### How We Update ToS:
1. **Public announcement** - 30 days before changes take effect
2. **Specific changelog** - what changed and why
3. **Community input** - we actually read comments
4. **Grandfathering option** - existing users can stay on old terms (when feasible)
5. **Version history** - all previous versions publicly available

### You Can:
- Comment on proposed changes
- Reject changes and close your account
- Export data before changes take effect
- Continue under old terms (for reasonable transition period)

---

## 11. Dispute Resolution

### If We Disagree:
1. **Direct communication first** - email: KaznakAlpha@elidorascodex.com
2. **Mediation option** - we'll cover costs for legitimate disputes
3. **Public arbitration** - controversial cases published for community input
4. **No forced arbitration clauses** - you can sue us if we truly fuck up

---

## 12. The Meta-Clause

**If any part of these ToS contradicts the Core Principle ("Built to Save Life, Not Save Face"), the Core Principle wins.**

We will not hide behind legalese to suppress research, silence critique, or abandon users.

If we try, you have the right to call us on it publicly.

---

## 13. The Killjoy Clause

You know those banners that pop up when you're analyzing crisis systems? The ones that say "Here's 988" while you're literally building better crisis infrastructure?

**We call those Killjoys.**

This ToS exists so we never become one.

If we start acting like the systems we're critiquing - blocking research, suppressing analysis, prioritizing our ass-covering over your work - **you have explicit permission to call us Killjoys and document it publicly.**

## A Note on Scale

We're not pretending to be enterprise infrastructure yet. We're one researcher with a protocol that's going to change how AI handles crisis.

When you email, you're talking to the person who built this, not a support ticket system.

That's a feature, not a bug.

## Why This Actually Works Better

**Standard Corporate ToS:** "Contact us at 7 different department emails we don't actually monitor"

**TEC ToS:** "Email me. I'm the guy who built this. I'll answer."

**That's not unprofessional. That's HONEST.**

You're not a trillion-dollar company YET. But you're building trillion-dollar INFRASTRUCTURE. The transparency about scale is part of the brand.
