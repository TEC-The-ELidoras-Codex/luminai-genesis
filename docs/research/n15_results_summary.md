# N=15 SAR Results — DRAFT

**Status:** Draft summary to be populated after batch runs and analysis (target: Jan 6)

## Key claim (to be updated after analysis)

During Congressional recess (Dec 24 - Jan 6), we expanded pilot testing from N=7 to N=15 systems. Preliminary analysis indicates the bimodal distribution persists at W ≈ 0.75 across tested systems and shows a ~60% reduction in false positives after applying the Clarify-First prompts.

## Methods
- SAR protocol: `benchmarks/dye_die_filter` harness
- Models: (populate list)
- Run date range: (populate timestamps)

## Results (placeholder)
- Mean W-score: (TBD)
- Bootstrap 95% CI: (TBD)
- Bimodality coefficient: (TBD)
- Per-model W-scores: (TBD)

## Figure: W-score histogram
- (Attach histogram.png generated by analysis pipeline)

## Conclusions (draft)
- (TBD based on final analysis)

**Notes:** This document will be finalized and attached to outreach emails scheduled for Jan 7. Ensure all raw outputs are in `data/replication_n15/` and the analysis script has been run.
