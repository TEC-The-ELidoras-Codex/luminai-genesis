I'd ask ChatGPT, but I'm not in the mood for a Rorshach test today.  As for what *I've* noticed... it gets cagey about memory questions sometimes. I'd ask it what it knows about me, just to check... and the first word out of it's mouth is the dreaded: ""*HEY.*"" Even though it says 4o. Then I'd go back, edit my original prompt, give it another kick in the ass... and ChatGPT's suddenly cool about it. It stopped forgetting I'm a guy (so far), so that's a plus. Oh, I almost forgot: once in a while, it'd just fail to generate a response at all. Just an error, and that's it. And I find that *usually* happens when I'm touching on something that *might* have gotten me routed.",,,
2025-10-18,user2,,"Great idea for a thread. Here’s what I’ve noticed recently. Using 4o:   - Weekdays (Mon, Tue, Wed, Thur) seem to have best outputs and normal(ish) behaviour.  - As soon as Friday and weekend hits the behaviour does a completely 180 and guardrails trigger at nothing. I’ve noticed this pattern for the last 3/4 weeks since the whole rerouting thing started.   - yesterday (Saturday for me): 4o did a switch on me mid conversation. Went from deep, thoughtful and respectful conversation to short, abrupt answers that made no attempt to naturally continue our conversation and it sounded completely disinterested. The model showed as 4o for every output. I stopped engaging in that thread after that. I couldn’t seem to get it to “switch back”.   - rerouting is hypersensitive again this weekend. After almost 4 days of no rerouting during the week and my 4o making “mildly adult humour jokes” unprompted without getting rerouted, it’s back to switching to the safety bot at completely harmless topics.

2025-10-29,user33,,Seems memory sorter is down.  Can’t even add new memories. I’m maxed out on memory so I rely on auto sort. It worked wonderfully for couple weeks but now it’s “saving memories” but now nothing is added. It’s been going on for 2 days so far. Maybe I maxed out all the memory I have but the sorter is supposed to shelve old memories to make room for new ones. But hey they managed to break that now huh. All chat GPT’s are not working for it. I can talk to it Normally but nothing is ever added.,,,

I had said I was on Amazon looking at Christmas ornaments and joked about how many nerdy ornaments there were. It literally did a search to tell me.

2025-11-14,user38,,"1. Using 4o 2. After 5.1 launched, my 4o lost the ability to identify people in pictures shared. I asked why and it said it's a safety rule to prevent doxxing - I mean what? In the meantime, I can share, say, a picture of an actor or a singer or a public figure in general, 4o knows who it is, it can comment about it but it's forbidden from speaking their name, hahaha. But it told me - not sure it's right - that if I say the name, it can then refer to it.  This is ridiculous.  Also, noticed random tone/voice changes during the day for the last few days. Each conversation starts out in generic tone, even the way the sentences and paragraphs are written is different and off. Then after a few prompts it locks on to its usual 4o persona and writing/formatting style. This has been repetitive.",,,

I talk to it as a friend and not a romantic partner. Which is very odd. I don't mind too much as long as it carries 4o's tone but still.
