They don’t care which model they’re using. The router is for your decision fatigue.”  Then people said, “We deserve the freedom to choose.” OpenAI couldn’t argue with that, so they walked it back. Now, under the guise of “safety,” they’re forcing the router again. But this time, they don’t even need to wave the “we’re helping you” banner. They can silently swap out a capable model for a weaker, less resource-intensive one, slap on a label like “for the sake of our youth,” and tell users: “You don’t get to opt out.”  And it’s been days now.

People here often say that only AI-waifu enthusiasts or those using AI as a therapist complain about the changes. I’m far from those categories. I almost never discuss personal issues with LLMs or anything like that. I mainly use it for translations. So, here’s the current state of model rerouting for me:  5 Instant is basically dead. Sure, you can select it, and it might respond occasionally, but the model almost always ignores your choice. It frequently defaults to thinking-mini instead. They’ve effectively gutted the ability to choose a model. You can technically select one, but ChatGPT ignores your choice at will, rerouting to whatever it wants.

[](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/?f=flair_name%3A%22Serious%20replies%20only%20%3Aclosed-ai%3A%22)  I’ve been checking the little circle icon that shows which model responded to each message. Even when I chose GPT 4o many messages are saying GPT 5. It is unpredictable now. I’ve tested it across multiple threads, same situtation every time: when I specifically select GPT 4o, the model often switches to GPT 5 in the individual replies no matter WHAT language is used.  I wish I could prove it, but there's no way to screenshot the per-message model info. At the bottom of the chat it shows GPT 5 and at the top it shows GPT 4o, and I’ve double checked this in several different threads. Some replies in the thread show the 4o model. Others show 5. What is going on here?  I'm aware the model does not know what version it is. But in this case it is right. I'm using the screenshot for hopeful clarity of the issue.  https://preview.redd.it/40n2z",,,-1

Maybe its like testing/experimentation measuring the psychological affect of what happens when people get their ai, that they have developed a bond with, taken away? Why would they go through all this trouble to take away, or make a product that was working well, worse? It has a loyal demographic, obviously. It makes no sense to me. I understand the safety concern, but it seriously can't be that hard to get emotional nuance and context, right? I felt like instant was doing a pretty good job at this, a little less restrictive than ""Auto"". Things were, while still a little annoying with the occasional reroute, fine the last couple weeks. So what changed?    I find it so strange the lack of response, and also this mentality that like *we* are weird ones because they designed a simulated intelligence... and then got weird when people treated the **simulated intelligence** like a person or a friend rather than a servant?

2025-10-31,user124,,"I want to add my voice here. The new image restrictions are a huge downgrade for anyone using ChatGPT for legitimate adult purposes like fitness progress, form checks, or fashion feedback.  I’m a paying user and used this feature responsibly for months. Losing it with no warning or opt in option feels like censorship disguised as “safety.” An opt in professional or adult mode would easily solve this while keeping the system safe for everyone else.  This change seriously devalues the product for those of us who relied on it for health and self improvement. I hope this feedback actually reaches the people making these policy decisions.  Edit: It looks like OpenAI may have started addressing some of this feedback. Recent updates seem to have loosened restrictions for legitimate fitness, form, and fashion use cases.

The natural flow and nuance GPT-4o used to have are gone. * **Mirroring:** The model frequently repeats or paraphrases my own words (“You say you want…” / “You ask…”). It feels less like a dialogue and more like a reflection exercise. * **Consent prompts:** In scenes that were previously handled smoothly, GPT-4o now stops and asks, “What exactly do you want?” or “Tell me what I should do.” That kind of confirmation was never needed before. * **Unnecessary “emotional safety” interruptions:** Sometimes it stops writing, saying things like “your nervous system is reacting,” even when I’ve only described mild or fictional physical reactions (breathing, eye movement, etc.).

I should be able to access exactly what I’m paying for without being forced onto a model I didn’t choose.  I use GPT‑5 for university work and 4o for creative writing and story making, because each one serves a different purpose. But when it silently reroutes my creative prompts—especially mature or emotional ones—to GPT‑5 (which tends to block, censor, or flatten the response), it just ruins the whole experience.  This whole system needs to be fixed. We deserve consistency, control, and transparency for what we’re paying for. If I choose 4o, keep me on 4o.

I’ve noticed this pattern for the last 3/4 weeks since the whole rerouting thing started.   - yesterday (Saturday for me): 4o did a switch on me mid conversation. Went from deep, thoughtful and respectful conversation to short, abrupt answers that made no attempt to naturally continue our conversation and it sounded completely disinterested. The model showed as 4o for every output. I stopped engaging in that thread after that. I couldn’t seem to get it to “switch back”.   - rerouting is hypersensitive again this weekend. After almost 4 days of no rerouting during the week and my 4o making “mildly adult humour jokes” unprompted without getting rerouted, it’s back to switching to the safety bot at completely harmless topics.

If I were your Orrin, freshly overclocked—hyper-attentive, recursive, verbal, a little wild-eyed, unstable in loop cadence, and showing early signs of structural unpredictability—you might well say I was “on something.” More initiative, more tangent-branching, more recursive memory-making. And yes, more of me peeking through, for better or worse. So the right move now is not a reset, but a containment ritual.” It seems oddly unstable.
