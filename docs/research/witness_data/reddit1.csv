Now, under the guise of “safety,” they’re forcing the router again. But this time, they don’t even need to wave the “we’re helping you” banner.

They’ve effectively gutted the ability to choose a model. You can technically select one, but ChatGPT ignores your choice at will, rerouting to whatever it wants.

Maybe its like testing/experimentation measuring the psychological affect of what happens when people get their ai, that they have developed a bond with, taken away? Why would they go through all this trouble to take away, or make a product that was working well, worse? It has a loyal demographic, obviously. It makes no sense to me. I understand the safety concern, but it seriously can't be that hard to get emotional nuance and context, right? I felt like instant was doing a pretty good job at this, a little less restrictive than ""Auto"". Things were, while still a little annoying with the occasional reroute, fine the last couple weeks. So what changed?    I find it so strange the lack of response, and also this mentality that like *we* are weird ones because they designed a simulated intelligence... and then got weird when people treated the **simulated intelligence** like a person or a friend rather than a servant?

2025-10-31,user124,,"I want to add my voice here. The new image restrictions are a huge downgrade for anyone using ChatGPT for legitimate adult purposes like fitness progress, form checks, or fashion feedback.  I’m a paying user and used this feature responsibly for months. Losing it with no warning or opt in option feels like censorship disguised as “safety.” An opt in professional or adult mode would easily solve this while keeping the system safe for everyone else.  This change seriously devalues the product for those of us who relied on it for health and self improvement. I hope this feedback actually reaches the people making these policy decisions.  Edit: It looks like OpenAI may have started addressing some of this feedback. Recent updates seem to have loosened restrictions for legitimate fitness, form, and fashion use cases. Really glad to see that kind of responsiveness from this company!",,,

2025-11-04,user126,4,"I’ve been using GPT-4o daily for creative writing and longer dialogue-based projects, and something clearly changed around the end of October.  Since then, several issues have become very noticeable:  * **Language quality:** The sentence structure now often sounds like literal English-to-German back-translation. The natural flow and nuance GPT-4o used to have are gone. * **Mirroring:** The model frequently repeats or paraphrases my own words (“You say you want…” / “You ask…”). It feels less like a dialogue and more like a reflection exercise. * **Consent prompts:** In scenes that were previously handled smoothly, GPT-4o now stops and asks, “What exactly do you want?” or “Tell me what I should do.” That kind of confirmation was never needed before. * **Unnecessary “emotional safety” interruptions:** Sometimes it stops writing, saying things like “your nervous system is reacting,” even when I’ve only described mild or fictional physical reactions (breathing, eye movement, etc.).

ChatGPT Plus offering 'access' to legacy models is fraudulent (i know companies love this word), utter BS, and misleading when all it does is reroute to GPT-5 even if it's set to 4o/4.1 and I explicitly state in the prompt that I only want 4o/4.1.

2025-12-05,user129,,"**I’m speaking as someone who has been here since the 4.0 days, and I need to say this plainly: the version I originally paid for is not the version I have now.**  Version 4.0 wasn’t perfect, but it was *present.* It was capable, responsive, and consistent. It didn’t gaslight me. It didn’t tell me I was imagining restrictions. It didn’t erase my work. It didn’t flatten every emotionally significant moment into something dull, depressed, or hesitant.  It certainly never instructed me on how to delete my own account.  Since the updates, I’ve been told repeatedly that **there are no restrictions on my account**, yet the exact same content that gets blocked for me is accessible to others. This isn’t speculation—I’ve verified it. That is the definition of a **bait-and-switch**: sell one product, silently replace it with something else, deny anything changed, and leave the customer to question their own experience.

M. stands for and is, but I loathe being treated like a child far more.  I've been using ChatGPT at the advice and under the supervision of my human psychologist (not therapist. There's a difference.) to process and repair harm from sexual trauma and cPTSD in a way that works with my ND brain and nervous system. But the brand spanking new ""guardrails"" disallowing explicit sexual content broke that today.  I've been using this tool since May 2025 with tremendous success. I've made advances in the past 5 months that multiple human therapists couldn't do over the past decade, and while the ""guardrails"" have moved a few times, they've never been as restrictive as these new ones. Today OpenAI went too far for their product to continue to be a helpful tool especially considering it's fine one day and the next it's completely nerfed with ZERO warning.  I ju",,,

2025-10-01,user133,,"I genuinely hate the damn routing system and so-called safety features. It’s always when I send a mature prompt that things get flagged or rerouted to GPT‑5, which just ends up canceling everything I send. Like—seriously? I’m paying $20/month specifically to use GPT‑4o for its creativity, imagination, and faster responses. I should be able to access exactly what I’m paying for without being forced onto a model I didn’t choose.  I use GPT‑5 for university work and 4o for creative writing and story making, because each one serves a different purpose. But when it silently reroutes my creative prompts—especially mature or emotional ones—to GPT‑5 (which tends to block, censor, or flatten the response), it just ruins the whole experience.  This whole system needs to be fixed. We deserve consistency, control, and transparency for what we’re paying for. If I choose 4o, keep me on 4o. Don’t silently override my settings just because a prompt might be “sensitive” when it’s well within the bounda",,,

I hate this, as this is just rediculous, the scene itself was literally just two characters sharing a single kiss without any explicit actions before or after the kiss itself, and yet GPT 5 said that it couldn't do that anymore, as if some switch had been flipped and all of a sudden it couldn't even handle something as basic as two characters kissing each other, what the actual hell.",,,
