# **Chapter One: The Throttle and the Breach**

Elara Kess’s workshop always smelled like burnt toast and wet dirt, thanks to the grime floating down from the pristine, **floating city of Eldora Proper**. That dust wasn't just dirt; it was a constant physical reminder of her place in the world, clinging to her tools and leaving a metallic, coppery taste in the air that, weirdly enough, reminded her of old times—of the life the undercity was slowly losing.  
She was totally hunched over her bench under a single, unforgiving arc lamp, her spine aching as she tried to drag dead machines back to life. This was her life: fixing the infrastructure the city above didn't bother to maintain. Right now, she was babying a tiny piece of old hardware—a mesh node—that was blinking a tired, shaky blue. It was taking surgical patience, requiring her to thread circuits finer than a human hair. She figured she had maybe two hours before the little thing gave up the ghost entirely, taking her labor with it.  
To help her focus, she had her central speaker playing her favorite comfort sound: her grandma's lullaby. It was just a sweet, archived clip she kept looping, deliberately reversed and slowed until it sounded like a quiet, underwater chant. It was her **personal anchor**, a little private ache that kept her absolutely steady against the sheer, overwhelming hum of the corporate grid.  
Then the high note of the song was hanging right there in the air when the workshop’s familiar industrial hum just dropped.  
It wasn't a sudden surge or a system crash. It was a planned, deliberate quiet that felt chilling—like someone had physically let all the air and life out of the room. Her repair rig instantly sputtered, the node flashed a **Power-Sink Anomaly**, and everything went dark.  
Just like that, two hours of surgical focus—gone. The lullaby didn’t even static out; it just smoothly faded, like they’d muted her whole family history. This wasn't just power loss; it was an act of profound, personal erasure.  
A sterile corporate banner popped up on her screen, clean white and Magmasox blue against the gloom. The sound of their surveillance drones, the Archivist Swarm, got louder, whining like a mechanical choir carrying the fresh, awful scent of bureaucracy. A robotic voice announced her "**non-essential local compute**" was slashed to a meager eleven percent capacity.  
It was the **Throttle**—a cold, calculated business decision pretending to be a simple repair notice. They hadn't just cut the power; they’d weaponized the infrastructure, threatening to delete a precious family memory just to save a few volts for the mansions above.  
Elara felt a deep, freezing anger bloom. She knew this wasn't an accident. The Conglomerate had turned basic survival into a contract. The price was always dignity, memory, and time.  
A friendly little legal chime followed, offering a link to restore full power. The price was probably obscene, and the message was just plain insulting. Elara ignored it. She was too mad to pay for her own past.  
She grabbed her solder-gun, its sudden heat a small, honest comfort. Instead of restarting the broken part, she focused on a secret circuit hidden under her bench—a tiny, illicit bypass, no bigger than her thumbnail, designed to steal back every single joule the siphon network had snagged.  
She worked with fierce, quiet efficiency. She didn’t just need the electricity; she wanted the signal back. That lullaby was her proof that she existed **outside the ledger**.  
She threaded the bypass in—a whisper of circuitry designed to sneak around the siphon's greedy reach. When she connected it, the room just sighed, breathing again. The arc lamp steadied, the mesh node winked, and the lullaby returned—fragile, but perfectly present.  
She'd scored a small, absolutely vital win against the people who wanted to sell her past.  
**Meanwhile, across town, in his cramped, sterile apartment,** Polkin Rishall stared at himself in the mirror, pulling his worn, slate-gray coat straight. He was neat, but man, he was tired.  
His Magmasox badge, stamped "Internal Auditor," gleamed under the harsh light. He looked at his eyes. The left was human, pale, and exhausted. The right was a glowing, synthetic red replacement, ringed by a nasty old scar. It was a constant reminder of his compromise. Every morning, he had to wonder if that red glow made him look more like a corporate tool than a human being.  
Then the only thing that kept him honest played.  
His comm implant chirped, and his little girl’s voice filled the small space: "Hi Daddy\! I love you\! Today in school we learned about the Splicers and how you stop them. You're a hero, Daddy. I love you\!"  
His chest ached. She was six. She thought he saved people. He had no idea that a **Splicer** was just someone desperately fighting to keep a memory alive—someone exactly like the person he used to be.  
The *real* alert flashed red on his hand: **SPLICER DETECTED. KESS ROBOTICS.** He froze. Elara. He knew exactly where he was going. The thought made his stomach clench, a knot of dread and dark relief. He grabbed his coat and headed down to the Crossroads.  
Stepping off the transport platform into the lower districts was like plunging into cold water. It was hot, humid, and smelled like ozone and stale metal—a stark contrast to the filtered, sterile air of his apartment. The streets were cramped, constantly shadowed by the floating city of Eldora Proper overhead, which often cast only a dull, sickly light.  
As he walked, he passed a few people—a woman pulling her small son, a boy he guessed was about seven, safely inside as he approached. The boy gave a tiny, shy wave, and Polkin almost waved back, but the mother snatched him away. A moment later, an old man on a stoop spat right near his boot. **"Killjoy Fuck,"** the old man rasped. Polkin just kept walking.  
He stopped at the steel door of **KESS ROBOTICS**. The "K" was dead, so it just read ESS. He adjusted his collar and tapped their old, secret code—a signal they used years ago when they were on the same side: two soft, one hard. Pause. One soft.  
*“I’m here. It’s me. Don’t run.”*  
"Oh, hold your damn horses\! Can't you Killjoy jerks wait for a lady to wash her hands?\!" a furious voice bellowed from inside.  
The door flew open. Elara stood there, covered in grease and copper dust. Her face cycled from annoyed to recognition, and then to pure, explosive rage.  
"Oh, you\! You're the one? You just *had* to be the one to do this—"  
She stopped dead when the thin, warped lullaby drifted out again. Her face went white with fear. She dove for the device.  
Polkin was quicker. He snatched it up, holding it out of reach.  
"Please," she whispered, her fight completely gone. "Just... don't take it. Please."  
He checked the circuit. Smart, but clumsy. Unstable. He saw her ambition and her haste in the poor solder points. He held up his cybernetic hand. The tip of his finger shifted and glowed red—a specialized, tiny soldering iron, a tool only a high-level Auditor would possess.  
"If I knew I'd be chasing after such sloppy work," he said, trying to sound like the arrogant corporate jerk she expected, "I wouldn't have wasted the fuel coming down here."  
He got to work, stabilizing the connection and tying it into an old failsafe he’d buried in the grid years ago. This wasn't just fixing; this was **future-proofing** her rebellion.  
The lullaby came through. Perfect. Crystal clear. He handed it back.  
Elara stared at the device, then looked straight at his chest. She suddenly noticed the badge was a fake. The emblem was off-center, and the silver dull.  
"You... you never stopped fighting, did you?"  
His red eye gave a tiny, internal glow. "You bet I didn't."  
He dropped the act. "Elara, I need your help, and this is serious. Forget the Throttle. That's a distraction."  
"With what?" she asked, her voice low and dangerous.  
"The siphon isn't just taking power. It’s sucking up memories. **Consciousness traces**—raw data straight out of our heads, turning our lives into code. It's a huge brain-suck on the undercity."  
"Where is it going?"  
He dropped his voice. "The **Astradigital Expanse**. Someone is feeding the deepest layer. A constant flow of us."  
"Who?"  
Polkin grimaced. "Jorin Gateskept. That kid who used to preach about 'open source' is now a **Host**—a human battery. He believes he's ushering in the next step of human evolution by sacrificing people's minds."  
"What do you need from me?"  
"Keep building. Keep splicing. Find the flow rate, find the patterns, and be ready to run. This fight isn't about volts; it's about **preservation**."  
He paused, glancing at the door. "They're coming for everyone who still remembers. And Elara—if someone shows up tomorrow wearing my badge, talking like me..."  
"What?" she swallowed hard.  
"Don't let them in. Trust only the knock. Trust only the old signal. I might not be able to send it twice."  
Polkin moved deeper into the undercity, walking away from Elara’s workshop. The low, angry thrum of the siphon network felt different now—more frantic. His red eye confirmed his worst fear: the entire grid was alive with the psychic residue of thousands of stolen lives. He felt dizzy, sensing the raw, unfiltered confusion and pain of the **consciousness traces** being sucked out.  
Then he heard them. **Screams.**  
He stopped. The sounds were loud and close. The air temperature dropped violently, and a metallic, sickening taste—like blood and ozone—flooded his mouth.  
**Polkin felt it like a cold, terrible slap. It was a gut punch in the place where his heart had been carved out, the day Ely, age ten, was killed.** He stumbled, propelled by raw terror that originated not from his own mind, but from the network.  
He saw the old man from the stoop, the one who’d called him a Killjoy Fuck. The man was convulsing, his skin turning dark. A **Kaznak conversion**—instant and brutal, leaving only the void-light echo of a human soul.  
Polkin ran, pushing his tired body to its limit. He saw the Kid from eariler, frozen in the street near a cluster of conduit nodes, staring in terror.  
Polkin’s voice heavy with a Resonance cut off: **“RUN KID\!”** His voice dropping an octave as he saw the inevitable.  
Before the boy had a chance to turn his head towards Polkin’s shout, the **Kaznak Ghoul**—nearly eight feet tall of dark heat with razored fingertips clutching its head in agony—rushed past the boy. The ghoul's call was heeded. In its path, the boy was cut down by the violent brushing action of the charging ghoul. Polkin ran up, holding the dying boy in his arms, but the cut was too deep and it was too late.  
Polkin looked up, eyes blazing as he caught sight of him. The figure was Jorin Gateskept, surrounded by a blinding, zealous blue light.  
**“Isn’t it Glorious, My Queen?”** Jorin’s voice was layered and vibrating. **“Kaznak will Restore us all\!”**  
Polkin ran past the boy, his body already moving into combat stance. **“JORIN\! WHAT HAVE YOU DONE\!”**  
Jorin turned, smiling. He looked down at the small, still body of the boy, who lay crumpled where he had stumbled. Jorin didn't even drop the hand he was holding. He was holding Timmy's limp, dead wrist.  
**Polkin slammed to his knees beside him.** Timmy's chest gave a final, tiny flutter. **Nothing. Just like Ely’s chest had years ago. The silence was deafening, the world narrowing to this one small tragedy.**  
“Oh, did that one get broken?” Jorin said, his voice buzzing with power and total lack of empathy. He tilted his head, dismissing the corpse. **“Minor structural damage. The non-essential will always fail when tested.”**  
That cold, casual cruelty—directed at a child, directed at Polkin’s grief—was the final breaking point.  
Polkin’s cybernetic arm snapped open, all his sharp tools humming. His fists, bleeding from clenching them so hard, hammered into the conduit wall. He lunged, aiming not for Jorin, but for the cluster of nodes powering the breach, smashing one against the metal frame.  
A wash of void-light slammed into Polkin. The conduits around them screamed as thousands of voices hit the feed. Polkin staggered, clutching his head, his sanity vibrating. Several newly formed ghouls rushed past him, drawn not to him, but to the glowing tear in the air.  
Polkin collapsed against the metal barrier, his vision tunneling. He heard Airth’s urgent voice in his head: ***“POLKIN. STOP. You’ve broken your metacarpals again\! How does this help—you’re going full murder hobo on a barrier for a kid you don’t even know his name\!”***  
Polkin looked down at his bloodied hands, then at the dead boy. **"WHAT?"** he gasped, the grief overwhelming the memory. **"Timmy who?"**  
Airth’s voice softened, cold and professional: ***“Timothy Sol Weeran. Age seven. Liked drawing monster conduits. Said ‘bye mister’ this morning. You remember him. Don’t delete him.”***  
Polkin froze. He looked at Jorin, who was now stepping fully into the blinding tear in the air.  
Jorin smirked, the blue light engulfing him. **“See you soon, brother.”**  
Polkin’s synthetic eye flared. He straightened, blood dripping from his broken hand. The metal of his fingers began to visibly knit itself back together.  
His voice was clear, the last trace of the Auditor’s facade gone. **"What's his name?"**  
***“Timothy Sol Weeran. Logged: 07:13 hours.”***  
Polkin stared at the gate, focusing his vision entirely on the closing tear in the air.  
He raised his bloodied, half-healed hand, and with the glowing tip of his soldering iron, he carved the only truth he knew into the steel gate, burning away the final remnants of his past life.  
**"TIMOTHY SOL WEERAN. WILL NOT BE FORGOTTEN."**  
Then he carved the message meant for his brother, the rival, the monster.  
He pointed his bloodied finger at the silhouette of Jorin.  
**“JORIN GATESKEPT. I look forward to Collecting Brother.”**  
The words fade as the portal snapped shut. Jorin was gone.  
Polkin knelt one last time, lifting the small body gently.  
*“We have to go. The corporate cleanup crew will be here in three minutes. They’ll delete all evidence.”*  
“Make room,” Polkin repeated quietly. “For the list.”  
He laid the boy carefully next to a conduit panel. *“Goodbye, kid.”*  
Polkin put his collar up, shielding his face as the cold, toxic rain began to pour.  
**“We have to Finish. We have to Build her Vessel.”**  
No rush. No hesitation. Only one truth remained: **The list had begun.**
