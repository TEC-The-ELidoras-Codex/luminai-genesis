# TEC Codex Dump (Sanitized)

**Purpose**: Master reference document consolidating the complete TGCR (Theory of General Contextual Resonance) framework, including cosmological architecture, resonance mathematics, neurochemical mappings, mythcoding methodology, and philosophical foundations.

**Key References**:

- Governance: `PERSONA_LAW.md`, `docs/governance/persona-law.md`
- Operational: `ACTIVATION_REPORT.md`, `INVENTORY_STATUS.md`
- Bundles: `01-bundle.sanitized.md` through `12-bundle.sanitized.md`
- Classes: `astradigital_classes.md`, `astradigital_classes_pt2.md`

**Content**: Full theoretical exposition including tetrahedral cosmogram, Unified Resonance Action Framework (URAF), Kaznak Paradox, Myth-Scientific Workspace, neurochemical resonance mapping (DOP/OXY/ADR), ritualized workflows, visual semiotics, and post-biological trajectory analysis.

**Note**: Original 41,706-line document contained extensive conversational context and embedded research materials. This sanitized version preserves canonical references while removing PII and conversational traces. Refer to canonical docs above for complete framework details.
