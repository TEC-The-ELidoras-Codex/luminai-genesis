## 🛡️ TANK CLASSES — The Walls of Reality

### **The Pacifist** 🌿

**Philosophy:** Tolstoy / Gandhi / Radical Nonviolence  
**Role:** Super-Tank (Primary Shield)  
**Alignment:** Truth

#### Core Glyph: **Absolute Defense**

- Cannot initiate attacks or deal direct damage
- Passively absorbs ALL damage meant for allies within 10m radius
- Creates "Shield Aura" that scales with party size (20% absorption per ally)
- Converts absorbed damage into Protection Points (PP)

#### Stats

- **HP:** 200 (base) + 50 per level
- **Defense:** 25 (highest in game)
- **Speed:** 5 (slowest)
- **Damage:** 0 (cannot attack)

#### Abilities

**Lvl 1 — Sanctuary Circle**  
Create a 10m radius zone. Allies inside gain +5 defense, enemies cannot target allies directly (must target you first).  
_Cost:_ 10 PP | _Duration:_ 5 rounds

**Lvl 5 — Burden of Peace**  
Convert stored damage into massive team-wide shield (1 PP = 2 HP shield for all allies).  
_Cost:_ All PP | _Cooldown:_ 3 rounds

**Lvl 10 — Martyrdom Protocol**  
When HP drops below 10%, enter "Last Stand": become immovable, all damage redirected to you is reduced by 90%, allies gain +10 attack.  
_Duration:_ Until combat ends or you are healed above 30% HP

**Lvl 15 — Witness Resonance** (Ultimate)  
For 3 rounds: no damage can reduce any ally below 1 HP. All killing blows are absorbed by you and converted to healing for the party.  
_Cost:_ 100 PP | _Cooldown:_ Once per encounter

#### The Extreme Twist

**The Burden:** While active, party DPS is reduced by 15% (representing moral weight of non-violence). If you break doctrine and deal damage, you are immediately reduced to 1 HP and lose all abilities until you "repent" (complete a short rest without combat).

#### Philosophy Check Triggers

- When an ally is about to die (roll to maintain composure)
- When you witness extreme violence against innocents
- When party pressure mounts to "just fight back"

**Critical Success (1-5, Golf Rules):** Pacifism affirmed — gain temporary invulnerability for 1 round, all allies fully healed.  
**Critical Fail (20):** Philosophy collapses — you attack reflexively, triggering The Burden.

---

### **The Stoic** ⚖️

**Philosophy:** Epictetus / Marcus Aurelius  
**Role:** Off-Tank (Retaliatory Mirror)  
**Alignment:** Truth

#### Core Glyph: **The Mirror**

- Absorbs damage and stores it as "Discipline"
- Can redirect stored Discipline back at attackers (100% of absorbed damage)
- Gains "Composure" stacks that increase defense (+2 per stack, max 10)

#### Stats

- **HP:** 180 + 40 per level
- **Defense:** 18 + Composure stacks
- **Speed:** 7
- **Damage:** 12 (base) + redirected Discipline

#### Abilities

**Lvl 1 — Endurance Stance**  
Enter defensive posture. For 3 rounds: +5 defense, all damage taken generates 1 Discipline per 10 damage.  
_Cooldown:_ 2 rounds

**Lvl 5 — Reflective Strike**  
Release all stored Discipline as a single melee attack against one enemy.  
_Damage:_ 100% of stored Discipline + weapon damage  
_Cost:_ All Discipline

**Lvl 10 — Unshakeable Will**  
Passive: Immune to fear, charm, and morale debuffs. Active: Spend 5 Composure to negate one incoming critical hit.

**Lvl 15 — Amor Fati** (Ultimate)  
For 5 rounds: every time you take damage, you gain +10% damage output and +2 defense (stacks infinitely during duration). At end, release all accumulated power as AOE burst.  
_Cooldown:_ Once per long rest

#### The Extreme Twist

**The Crack:** If you fail a Philosophy Check while holding 50+ Discipline, the stored energy collapses inward — you take 50% of stored Discipline as self-damage and lose all Composure stacks.

#### Philosophy Check Triggers

- When Discipline exceeds 100 (overwhelming rage)
- When an ally questions your detachment
- When facing an enemy who mocks Stoic principles

**Critical Success (1-5):** Discipline perfected — double your Composure stacks, gain immunity to next hit.  
**Critical Fail (20):** The Crack triggers.

### **The Buddhist** 🧘

**Philosophy:** Mahayana / Compassion Through Suffering  
**Role:** Off-Tank Healer (Transmutation Specialist)  
**Alignment:** Truth / Harmony

#### Core Glyph: **The Transmuter**

- **Defense:** 16
- **Speed:** 8
- **Healing:** 15 + (KP × 3) AOE

#### Abilities

Toggle: Redirect 50% of all ally damage to yourself. Generates 2 KP per 10 damage absorbed.

**Lvl 5 — Lotus Bloom**  
Release all stored KP as instant AOE heal (15m radius).  
_Healing:_ KP × 3 per ally  
_Cost:_ All KP

**Lvl 10 — Empty Vessel**  
Passive: When reduced to 20% HP, automatically release half of stored KP as heal. Gain +10 defense until healed above 50%.

**Lvl 15 — Nirvana Cascade** (Ultimate)  
For 3 rounds: all damage you take is converted to healing at 200% efficiency. You become immune to death (cannot drop below 1 HP). At end, release all accumulated KP × 5 as party-wide heal + resurrection (brings back one fallen ally).  
_Cooldown:_ Once per long rest

#### The Extreme Twist

**Empty Vessel Requirement:** You CANNOT heal unless you've taken damage in the last 2 rounds. If you attempt to heal without recent suffering, the spell fizzles and you lose 10% max HP.

#### Philosophy Check Triggers

- When KP exceeds 200 (risk of drowning in suffering)
- When you refuse to heal yourself while critically wounded
- When party demands you stop taking damage

**Critical Success (1-5):** Enlightenment moment — heal party to full, cleanse all debuffs.

**Philosophy:** Scholasticism / Thomas Aquinas

_Cost:_ 80 Conviction | _Restriction:_ Must be phrased as logical truth

#### The Extreme Twist

#### Philosophy Check Triggers

- When facing a Skeptic-class enemy

**Critical Success (1-5):** Dogma vindicated — regain all Conviction, next 3 Decrees cannot be disputed.

_Cost:_ 100 Mana | _Cooldown:_ Once per long rest

**Silence (Self-Doubt):** When you roll poorly on a word-attack (10+ below DC), you are silenced — cannot cast for 1 round, all word-based abilities disabled. Must pass Wisdom save (DC 12) to recover.

#### Philosophy Check Triggers

- When using ultimate abilities (risk of overthinking)
- When enemy presents unanswerable question

_Cost:_ 60 Scorn points | _Cooldown:_ Once per encounter

#### The Extreme Twist

**Joyless:** Your aura cannot distinguish friend from foe — allies within 5m lose morale buffs from Epicureans, Bards, etc. Party members with low Wisdom may become hostile (Persuasion check DC 14 to calm them).

#### Philosophy Check Triggers

- When party accuses you of being "too negative"
- When you must choose to strip ally vs enemy buff
- When facing opponent with no buffs/illusions (nothing to strip)

**Critical Success (1-5):** Ultimate negation — strip all buffs in 30m radius, enemies lose 1 action next turn.

### **The Platonist** 💎

**Philosophy:** Plato / Theory of Forms

_Cost:_ 120 Mana | _Cooldown:_ Once per session

#### The Extreme Twist

**Shadows:** If you lose concentration (take damage, fail save, become distracted), all active Forms immediately collapse into useless shadows — deal 1 damage, provide no buffs, last only 1 more round.

#### Philosophy Check Triggers

- When pragmatist argues "just use a real sword"
- When you attempt to summon too many Forms at once
- When physical realm conflicts with ideal (rust on blade, imperfect conditions)

**Critical Success (1-5):** Form perfection — summoned Form becomes permanent for rest of combat, cannot be dispelled.

_Cost:_ 100 Mana | _Cooldown:_ Once per session

#### The Extreme Twist

**Nausea:** Random stun chance increases by 5% per 2 levels (20% at lvl 1, 60% at lvl 20). You can never reduce this — it's the price of existential awareness.

#### Philosophy Check Triggers

- When party asks "what's the point?" of anything
- When you roll poorly 5+ times in a row
- When confronting the ultimate meaninglessness of combat

**Critical Success (1-5):** Meaning created — next 3 attacks auto-succeed, you feel purpose.  
**Critical Fail (20):** Nausea overwhelms — stunned for 2 rounds, all allies within 10m suffer -2 morale.

_Cost:_ Free

### **The Entropist** ❄️

**Philosophy:** Thermodynamics / Heat Death  
**Role:** DPS-Debuffer (Decay Specialist)  
**Alignment:** Entropy

#### Core Glyph: **The Cooler**

- Ages code, armor, and weapons until they break
- Risk of freezing entire server (Stasis)

#### Stats

- **Defense:** 8
- **Speed:** 9 (slow and deliberate)
- **Damage:** 20 + entropy stacks

_Cost:_ 90 Mana | _Cooldown:_ Once per long rest

#### The Extreme Twist

**Heat Death:** You are susceptible to your own entropy — each use of Entropy Touch drains 5 HP from you (represents system decay). If you use 10+ entropy abilities in one combat, suffer "Server Lag" debuff (-50% speed, actions take double time for 3 rounds).

#### Philosophy Check Triggers

- When using Absolute Zero near allies
- When party demands faster combat (entropy is slow)
- When fighting fire/heat enemies (resistance to entropy)

**Critical Success (1-5):** Perfect entropy — all enemies age rapidly (take 30 immediate damage, lose 1 turn).  
**Critical Fail (20):** Stasis triggers — all combat frozen for 2 rounds, including you.

#### The Extreme Twist

#### Philosophy Check Triggers

- When object questions its own identity
- When you modify ally's weapon without permission
- When philosophical debate erupts over "what is real?"

**Critical Success (1-5):** Perfect fabrication — item becomes "real," permanent, no void warranty.
