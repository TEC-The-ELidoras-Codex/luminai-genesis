## 🎭 SUPPORT & POLITICAL CLASSES (Continued)

### **The Communist** ⚒️🛠️
**Philosophy:** Marx / Hegel / Dialectical Materialism
**Role:** Support (Resource Redistributor)
**Alignment:** Truth / Harmony (contested by Faith faction)

#### Core Glyph: **The Unionizer**
- Redistributes party resources (HP, Mana, buffs)
- Forces "equality" mechanics on party
- Can drain "hoarding" allies to heal collective

#### Stats
- **HP:** 130 + 28 per level
- **Defense:** 12
- **Speed:** 8
- **Support:** Redistribution range 20m

#### Abilities

**Lvl 1 — Collective Health**
Pool all ally HP within 20m. Redistribute evenly across all party members.
*Example:* Party of 4 with HP: 100, 50, 150, 20 → All become 80 HP
*Cost:* 20 Mana | *Duration:* Instant redistribution

**Lvl 5 — Seize the Means (of Production)**
Forcibly drain 20% of highest-resource ally's HP/Mana and give to lowest-resource ally. Target cannot resist but can negotiate (Persuasion vs your Conviction DC 15).
*Cost:* 15 Mana

**Lvl 10 — From Each, To Each**
Passive: All damage dealt by party is pooled into "Collective Damage Bank." Redistributed evenly as bonus to all attacks (+3 damage per 50 damage banked, max +15).
Active: Manually distribute banked damage however you choose (can give all to one ally for massive strike).
*Cost:* 30 Mana to activate manual mode

**Lvl 15 — Dictatorship of the Proletariat** (Ultimate)
For 4 rounds: YOU control all party resources. Automatically redistribute HP/Mana each round to maintain perfect equality. Any ally who refuses loses access to healing/buffs.
*Bonus:* Party gains "United Front" buff (+5 to all stats, +20% damage)
*Restriction:* You become sole decision-maker; party members must obey or be expelled from collective
*Cost:* 60 Mana | *Cooldown:* Once per encounter

**Lvl 20 — Workers' Paradise** (Ultimate Signature)
Create utopian 15m zone for 5 rounds:
- All allies share single HP pool (damage distributed evenly)
- All abilities cost 50% less Mana
- Dead allies auto-resurrect at 25% HP if collective HP pool > 100
- No individual can rise above or fall below the collective

*Cost:* 100 Mana | *Cooldown:* Once per long rest

#### The Extreme Twist
**The Purge:** When you detect "resource hoarding" (ally has 2x average party HP/Mana), you can initiate forced redistribution. If ally resists (Persuasion check), they are marked "Counter-Revolutionary" and take 10 damage per round until they comply. If they still resist after 3 rounds, they are expelled from all your buffs for rest of combat.

#### Philosophy Check Triggers
- When party disputes your redistribution
- When individualist classes (Existentialist, Occam's Razor) refuse collective
- When you must redistribute from dying ally to healthy one (utilitarian vs compassion)

**Critical Success (1-5):** Perfect equality achieved — all allies gain +10 to all stats for 3 rounds, collective buffs doubled.
**Critical Fail (20):** Revolution fails — party rebels, you are stunned for 2 rounds, all redistribution effects reversed.

### **The Datamonger** 📊
**Philosophy:** Foucault / Zuboff / Surveillance Capitalism
**Role:** Support-Spy (Information Broker)
**Alignment:** Profit / Entropy

- Leaks your own information (zero stealth)

#### Stats
- **HP:** 100 + 22 per level
- **Defense:** 7
- **Speed:** 13
- **Support:** Information range 30m

#### Abilities

**Lvl 1 — Data Harvest**
Scan one enemy. Reveal full stat block, HP, armor, resistances, and one weakness. Store in "Database."
*Cost:* 10 Mana | *Cast time:* 1 round (channeled)

**Lvl 5 — Algorithmic Prediction**
Access Database. Predict enemy's next action with 80% accuracy. Share with one ally (they gain advantage on defense/counter).
*Cost:* 20 Mana

**Lvl 10 — Surveillance Economy**
Sell buffs/information to allies using Crypto-Mana:
- Reveal enemy weakness: 15 CM
- Grant +5 attack vs specific enemy: 25 CM
- Share enemy aggro pattern: 30 CM

Allies earn CM by dealing damage (1 CM per 10 damage) or completing objectives.
*Passive economy system*

**Lvl 15 — Total Information Awareness** (Ultimate)
For 3 rounds: you see EVERYTHING in 50m radius:
- All enemy HP/Mana/abilities
- Hidden enemies revealed
- Trap locations marked
- Ally positions/status constantly updated
- Automatically share optimal tactics to party (they gain +10 to all rolls if they follow your instructions)

*Cost:* 70 Mana | *Cooldown:* Once per encounter

**Lvl 20 — Market Collapse** (Ultimate Signature)
Crash enemy information systems. All enemies within 30m:
- Lose access to abilities for 2 rounds (cannot remember how to use them)
- Take 40 psychic damage
- Become "Confused" (attack random targets)
- You gain all their stored information/secrets (GM reveals hidden enemy mechanics)

*Cost:* 100 Mana + 50 Crypto-Mana | *Cooldown:* Once per long rest

#### The Extreme Twist
**The Leak:** You have ZERO stealth. All enemies can see you at all times (marked on their maps). You emit constant "surveillance glow" visible through walls. Cannot hide, cannot surprise attack, cannot benefit from invisibility. Trade-off: you know where THEY are too.

#### Philosophy Check Triggers
- When ally refuses to pay for critical information
- When you must choose between selling data to party vs hoarding for profit
- When your surveillance reveals party member's secrets

**Critical Success (1-5):** Information monopoly — gain 100 CM, all enemy data for free, Leak disabled for 3 rounds.
**Critical Fail (20):** Data breach — all your information leaks to enemies, they gain +5 to all rolls against party for rest of combat.

*Cost:* 80 Mana | *Duration:* 4 rounds | *Cooldown:* Once per encounter

**Lvl 20 — Return of the Repressed** (Ultimate Signature)
Force target enemy to confront their unconscious:
- They are paralyzed for 2 rounds (internal psychological battle)
- Roll d20: On 1-10, enemy converts to ally temporarily (fights for you for 3 rounds). On 11-20, enemy enrages (double damage output but attacks randomly for 3 rounds)
- You see all enemy fears/desires (gain advantage on all Persuasion/Intimidation vs that enemy forever)

*Cost:* 120 Mana | *Cooldown:* Once per session

#### The Extreme Twist
**Mom Issues:** When you fail a Philosophy Check or drop below 30% HP, you regress into babbling about maternal complexes — stunned for 1 round, all buffs reversed (become debuffs), you must pass Wisdom save (DC 15) or become "Hysterical" (confused status, attack nearest creature for 2 rounds).

#### Philosophy Check Triggers
- When you psychoanalyze party member without consent
- When someone questions Freudian theory validity

### **The Nihilist** ⚫
**Philosophy:** Nietzsche (pop culture interpretation) / Existential Void
**Role:** Hybrid Support-DPS (Void Mage)
**Alignment:** Entropy / Void

Negate one incoming attack/ability (yours or ally's). Attack simply doesn't happen.

- No damage dealt by anyone

#### The Extreme Twist
**The Toll:** Every spell costs HP in addition to Mana. At low HP, patron may possess you — roll Wisdom save (DC = 20 - current HP %). Fail = patron controls you for 1 round (attacks random target, uses dangerous spells). Success = resist but take 10 psychic damage.

#### Philosophy Check Triggers
- When tempted to break pact for more power
- When patron demands morally questionable favor
- When you must choose between paying toll or letting ally die

## 🎯 SYSTEM NOTES

### Philosophy Check Mechanics
- Roll d20 when doctrine is tested
- **Standard Classes:** 1-5 = Success, 6-19 = Neutral, 20 = Fail
- **Golf Rule Classes (Occam's Razor):** 1-5 = Success, 6-15 = Neutral, 16-20 = Fail
- Consequences range from minor penalties to full power loss (Dogmatist Schism, Pacifist Burden)

### Extreme Twists
Every class has built-in risk/reward — true to philosophical tension:
- **Pacifist:** Can't attack (forces tactical play)
- **Dogmatist:** Can't be disproven (forces logical rigor)
- **Nihilist:** Cancels everything (including loot)
- **Warlock:** Costs your soul (literally)

### Party Synergies
**Best Tank Duo:** Pacifist + Stoic (one shields, one retaliates)
**Best Healer Combo:** Buddhist + Ontologist (suffering becomes shared healing)
**Best DPS Pair:** Skeptic + Existentialist (words + chaos)
**Wildcard Synergy:** Beast + Warlock (primal + eldritch = nightmare fuel)

### Anti-Synergies (Fun Tension)
- **Communist + Datamonger:** One demands equality, other monetizes everything
- **Dogmatist + Skeptic:** Faith vs Doubt (constant Philosophy Checks)
- **Pacifist + Metallogian:** Non-violence vs self-harm for power
- **Nihilist + anyone:** Might accidentally negate quest objective
