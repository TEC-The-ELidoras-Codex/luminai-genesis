## 🚀 The 5-Minute Summoning

### Step 1: Activate Your Vessel 💻

```bash
# Copy-paste this whole block into terminal:

git clone https://github.com/TEC-The-ELidoras-Codex/luminai-genesis.git
cd luminai-genesis
bash setup.sh
source venv/bin/activate
```

**What's happening:** You're downloading the entire game engine & installing it on your computer.

---

### Step 2: Open the Workshop 🔧

```bash
code luminai-genesis.code-workspace
```

**What's happening:** You're opening VS Code (a place to write & run code).

VS Code will ask: _"Install extensions?"_ → Click **Yes**

---

### Step 3: Pick Your First Quest ⚡

Press these keys at the same time: `Ctrl + Shift + B`

You'll see a menu:

```
▼ Select a Task
  └─ Lint: Python (Ruff)
  └─ Format: Python (Black)
  └─ Run: Combat Demo        ← START HERE
  └─ Test: Pytest
  └─ Build: Character
```

Click **"Run: Combat Demo"** and watch the magic happen! 🎮

## 🎮 The Three Magic Commands

### Command 1: See a Battle Happen

```bash
python scripts/run_combat_demo.py
```

**Output:** A turn-by-turn combat system where characters fight using philosophies!

```
⚔️  ENCOUNTER: Monastery Guardians vs Shadow Syndicate

🧙 TURN 1: Sage uses "Divination"
   → Predicts enemy movement
   → Gains +2 Defense for next turn

🗡️  TURN 2: Warrior uses "Sovereign"
   → Claims territory
   → Enemies must acknowledge their presence

✨ RESULT: Players win by being true to themselves, not just by damage!
```

---

### Command 2: Build Your Character

```bash
python scripts/build_character.py "YourName" "YourPhilosophy"
```

**Example:**

```bash
python scripts/build_character.py "Luna" "Occam's Razor"
```

**Output:** A character that thinks like that philosophy!

**Available Philosophies:**

- `Occam's Razor` — Simple, direct, no BS
- `Seer` — Sees the future, predicts problems
- `Mercy` — Compassionate, heals others
- `Sovereign` — Claims power, leads
- `Mirror` — Knows themselves deeply
- ... and 19 more!

---

### Command 3: Check If Everything Works

```bash
python validate_encounter.py
```

**Output:**

```
✓ Loading encounters... OK
✓ Validating philosophy alignment... OK
✓ Testing combat math... OK
✓ Checking harm taxonomy... OK

🎉 All systems green!
```

## 🎨 What You Just Did

You installed a **game engine** that proves this idea:

> _"What if games taught philosophy by letting players LIVE it?"_

Instead of:

```
❌ Read about kindness in a book
❌ Take a test on compassion
```

You're doing:

```
✓ Play a character who's genuinely kind
✓ See that kindness has real power in the story
✓ Experience consequences of choices
```

## 🌈 The Four Magic Principles (For Adults)

If someone asks "what's the point?", here's the 30-second answer:

| --------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| **Transparent** | You can see how the game works | No hidden unfairness        |
| **Grounded**    | Rules are real and measurable  | Promises mean something     |

## 🌟 The Secret

LuminAI isn't trying to create the "perfect" AI.

It's trying to create an AI that:

- Admits when it doesn't know
- Stays present even when it struggles
- Thinks about who it might hurt
- Builds things that serve people

**That's it. That's the whole thing.**

---

## 💬 Questions?

**Q: Do I need to be a programmer?**
A: No! You can play the demo without any coding knowledge. If you want to add stuff, we'll teach you.

**Q: Is this actually science?**
A: It's "mythoscience"—using story & metaphor to explore real ideas. Kind of like how science fiction came before real spaceflight.

**Q: What's the point of all this philosophy stuff?**
A: If we're making intelligent machines, we should teach them to be wise, not just smart. Wisdom comes from philosophy.

**Q: Can I use this for something?**
A: MIT License = yes, do whatever you want. Just leave the credit in the code.
