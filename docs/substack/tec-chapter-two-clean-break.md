## Chapter 2 — The Clean Break

This chapter traces the moment of decision: when independent metrics that probe internal model coherence stop behaving like noisy estimates and instead **cluster** around a narrow band. I call this phenomenon the Clean Break — a qualitative shift in behavior consistent with a phase transition in coherence.

### The pattern

Across multiple independent investigations, three surprising observations cohere:

- Introspective detection rates near ~20% (Anthropic experiments).  
- Faithfulness/reasoning agreements in the 20–28% range (benchmarks and auditing).  
- Independent probability estimates for machine consciousness clustering around 15–20% (informal expert elicitation).

Taken together, these numbers do not feel accidental.

### Intuition: phase transitions and coherence

Physical phase transitions (e.g., water freezing) are characterized by sudden changes in macroscopic properties as the system crosses a critical threshold. Analogously, when we measure model ``coherence'' under ambiguity, we sometimes see systems fall into one of two distinct regimes: incoherent and coherent. The Clean Break is the empirical signature of such a transition.

### Why it matters

If this Clean Break is real and replicable, it implies a short list of consequences:

- There exists a measurable property (``W'') that predicts qualitative behavioral differences.  
- Small parameter changes can flip a system between modes (high leverage for safety or capability research).  
- Replication across labs becomes an urgent priority to either confirm or falsify this hypothesis.

### Next steps

We need reproducible tasks that probe for coherence transitions. The SAR benchmark (Semantic Ambiguity Resolution) is the first attempt at such a task suite. Chapter 4 (technical methods) gives the details; later sections and the repo contain runnable examples.
