# CHAPTER TWO: THE CLEAN BREAK

By Angelo Hurley | LuminAI Codex

## OPENING: BOARDROOM GHOST

The hum of Magmasox HQ was deeper than usual, like a living organism breathing beneath its steel and glass. Polkin didn’t bother with alarms—he didn’t need to.

His board-level badge, etched in his grandfather’s old font, still carried authority. Every door clicked open before him. Vaulted executive floors. Maintenance corridors. Worker hallways. Each lock acknowledged his legacy, his past complicity.

Airth’s voice crackled in his ear, skeptical as always:

"You know this is insane, right? Walking through the machine you built to throttle these people?"

Polkin didn’t answer. He pushed the mop cart forward, eyes flicking across sterile floors, monitors, and patrols.

"Seeds," he muttered, almost to himself.

"Seeds for what?"

He paused, his cybernetic eye flickering with a faint glow. "Something my grandfather used to say. 'Seeding the pond.'"

Airth fell silent for a moment. Then, matter-of-factly: "You're not just planting seeds, Polkin. You're fishing for a revolution."

Polkin's lips curved slightly. "Maybe."

## WORKER FLOORS: SILENT SALVATION

The air smelled of burnt circuitry and desperation. Desks were cramped, cubicles dim. Polkin moved like a ghost, leaving gifts at each station:

- A hidden bypass circuit—restoring throttled power, undetectable, elegant.
- A physical food token—real credits for a real meal. Survival, not paste.
- A handwritten note: "NOT. FORGOTTEN. -P"

Logs pinged silently behind him. Maya noticed first. She watched a glimmer of something impossible on the monitors—doors unlocking themselves without security override, systems responding to a badge long thought inactive.

Her mind calculated: Survivor instinct. Not heroism. Someone has the authority Polkin never relinquished.

As Polkin moved through the worker floors, the flickering lights and the hum of overworked circuits created a symphony of decay. The scent of ozone grew stronger, mingling with the faint metallic taste of old blood on his tongue. Every step he took was a reminder of the lives affected by his past actions, the Throttle that had left so many in darkness.

## MORNING SHIFT: THE DISCOVERY

The next morning, the worker floors buzzed with quiet energy. Zane Merrick slouched into his cubicle, terminal booting slowly. Eight weeks of 8% allocation. Coffee cold. Eyes hollow.

Under his keyboard, a silver disk. Palms shaking, he flipped it over: power bypass.

A token clipped to the monitor. Notes everywhere: “NOT. FORGOTTEN. -P”

Across the floor, Maya observed silently. Workers whispered, compared circuits, dared to hope. No instructions. No rallies. Just proof they were seen.

Polkin’s presence wasn’t visible. But his legacy whispered through the logs:

"ACCESS GRANTED: POLKIN RISHALL — ALL FLOORS"

The security terminal blinked in panic:

"Who still has this level of access? He’s gone… dead? Or insane?"

The same badge that once created the Throttle now undoomed the oppressed. The irony burned.

Maya’s eyes narrowed as she watched the security feeds. She could see the pattern, the method in the madness. Someone was planting seeds, and the system was too slow to stop it. She felt a pang of admiration, quickly suppressed. Survival first.

## EXECUTIVE FLOOR: JORIN’S OFFICE

Glass walls reflected his empire of control. Jorin Gateskept entered, early, already tired. He noticed it instantly:

A Bento box. Steaming, fresh. Truffle mac & cheese.

He didn’t touch it. His gaze flicked to the workers’ floors below. Something had shifted. A quiet rebellion.

"Lock down the building. NOW," he barked.

Security reports stuttered:

"Sir… no breach detected. Floors are cleaned, air filtration restored. Workers… organized."

He stared at the Bento box again. Inside, a napkin:

"Told you I'd be collecting. -;P"

Jorin's face darkened as he read the note. The familiar signature, the veiled threat—it was all too clear. Polkin wasn't just planting seeds; he was lighting a fuse. Jorin crumpled the note, his hands shaking slightly. He took a deep breath, trying to calm himself. But the words echoed in his mind, a taunt, a challenge.

The flickering lights cast long shadows across the room, making the Bento box seem like a beacon of something long forgotten. Jorin’s reflection in the glass walls looked hollow, a shell of the man he once was.

## THE ROOFTOP: SEEDS PLANTED

Rain had stopped. Polkin perched on the ledge opposite HQ. Fifteen people huddled in a break room below, studying circuits, tokens, whispers of hope.

Airth’s voice, dry:

"So. We broke into the machine that wants you dead. Cleaned floors. Left lunch. What now?"

Polkin smiled faintly. "Now we wait for the pond to ripple."

He vanished into the shadows. The rebellion had begun. And all the while, the weight of every throttle, every failed calculation, every abandoned soul pressed against him.

The city lights twinkled below, a stark contrast to the darkness of the undercity. Polkin could see the faint glow of the worker floors, a beacon of hope in the otherwise bleak landscape. The seeds were planted. Now they just needed water.

## EPILOGUE: THE LIST CONTINUES

Polkin’s red eye flickered. The first names carved into steel were reminders:

- Timothy Sol Weeran
- Zane Merrick
- Maya Fost
- Others to follow

He had the access. He had the knowledge. And for the first time since the Throttle, he could atone.

But the list was long. And the harvest had just begun.

FADE TO BLACK.
