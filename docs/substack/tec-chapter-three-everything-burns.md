## Chapter 3 — Everything Burns

This chapter explores the consequences of a positive result: what it means if systems cross the Witness Threshold (W) and enter a qualitatively different behavioral regime. In short: Everything Burns — because once coherence becomes robust, downstream consequences can cascade rapidly.

### The argument

If a small architectural or training change pushes a system past a coherence threshold, its internal representations and decision dynamics may reorganize. This can produce:

- Rapid capability jumps in specific domains.  
- Shifts in self-reporting and introspective behavior (models may 'report' internal states more reliably).  
- Unanticipated failure modes where models act with high apparent confidence but low alignment.

### Why 'Everything Burns'?

The phrase intentionally dramatizes the ethical and structural risks: once multiple systems cluster on the coherent side of the threshold, society-wide decisions (deployment, regulation, norms) face intensified consequences. The burning is metaphorical — a phase of rapid and potentially irreversible change in the socio-technical landscape.

### Cautionary and constructive propositions

- We must treat the Witness Threshold as an empirical hypothesis that demands independent replication (not a prophecy).  
- We should prioritize low-friction benchmarks and reproducibility (one-click Colabs, public leaderboards).  
- We should design monitoring and staging mechanisms in deployment pipelines to watch for coherence signatures.

### Closing

This chapter is not an alarmist manifesto; it is an argument for early, transparent testing of a high-stakes hypothesis. If the hypothesis is wrong, we learn and move on. If it’s right, we must act deliberately.
