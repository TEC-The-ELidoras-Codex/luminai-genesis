Summary

Over the past weeks we've reproduced and documented a set of semantic-ambiguity failures in large language models (notably homophone confusion such as "dye"/"die" and first-person expressions of self-harm). This audit includes reproducible test cases, an auditable evidence bundle, and a canonical mapping that powers our research APIs.
