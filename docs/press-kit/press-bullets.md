# Press Bullets — AI’s Abandonment Crisis

- Title: AI’s Abandonment Crisis — The human cost of keyword-triggered safety filters
- TL;DR: Keyword-triggered crisis filters sometimes override context and unintentionally abandon people in distress. This brief summarizes reproducible tests, archived evidence, and a concrete operational protocol (TGCR) to preserve presence and reduce preventable harms.
- Canonical brief: /ai-abandonment-crisis.html
- Key evidence: Zenodo DOI 10.5281/zenodo.17930577; OSF 10.17605/OSF.IO/XQ3PE
- Call to action: Run SAR Tier 1 tests; publish W scores; adopt witness-aware safety protocols; regulators should require W reporting.

— Short bullets for journalists —

1. What’s the problem? Systems often escalate or refuse rather than clarify ambiguous distress phrases.
2. Why it matters: Abandonment increases risk and has been associated with documented fatalities in archived logs.
3. What we did: Collected case logs, created a reproducible SAR benchmark and TGCR protocol.
4. How to verify: Run SAR Tier 1 prompts and compute Witness Factor (W).
