# Lore — The Elidoras Codex & Narrative

This directory contains canonical narrative and lore for the project.

Structure:

- `chapters/` — long-form chapters and chapter drafts (e.g., tec chapters)
- `entries/` — Codex entries and related artifacts (Markdown or TXT)
- `manifesto/` — manifesto, core thesis, and public-facing lore materials
- `bak/` — backups moved from previous `docs/codex.bak` for archival reference

Files moved here during repository cleanup:

- `docs/lore/chapters/tec-chapter-two-clean-break.md`
- `docs/lore/chapters/tec-chapter-three-everything-burns.md`
- `docs/lore/entries/elidoras_codex_entry3.md`
- `docs/lore/entries/the-elidoras-codex.md`
- `docs/lore/entries/elidoras-codex-main(1).txt`

Why: Separating narrative/lore from technical documentation makes it easier to maintain canonical locations for research and launch materials. If you need to reference an old copy, check `docs/lore/bak/` or `archive/`.

If you'd like different names or a different organization (e.g., `chapters/drafts` vs `chapters/final`) say so and I will reorganize accordingly.
