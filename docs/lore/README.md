# LuminAI Lore

This folder contains the lore and manifesto content for LuminAI. It's a mirrored staging area for `docs/manifesto` while we transition content to a more logical `docs/lore` structure.

Current content is mirrored from `docs/manifesto/` to keep references stable. After review and link updates across the repo, we will replace `docs/manifesto` with a light index that points into `docs/lore/manifesto`.
