## LuminAI Pilot Protocol (3-month pilot)

## Overview

This pilot aims to validate that LuminAI Continuity Partner improves session efficiency and reduces crisis escalation for clients in need (including substance use/harm-reduction contexts).

## Pilot Design

- Participants: 5 therapists + 20 clients (therapists can each host 3-5 clients)
- Duration: 3 months
- Metrics:
  - Session time saved (minutes of recap removed)
  - Client-perceived continuity (pre/post survey 7-point scale)
  - Crisis events pre/post metric (number of after-hours escalations)
  - Therapist burnout scale (pre/post survey)

## Consent & Privacy

- Clients will opt-in and grant explicit consent for weekly summary sharing with their therapist.
- Data minimization: clients can mark messages as private (won’t be shared with therapist)
- Basic data retention: only 3 months for pilot; then archived or deleted.

## Technical Plan

1. Setup: install MVP server in a private demo environment and run setup_db.sh
2. Onboarding: 1-hour session for therapists and clients
3. Data collection: System logs messages and cravings for analytics
4. Weekly reports: auto-delivered to assigned therapist

## Safety & Harm-Reduction

- LuminAI offers harm-reduction suggestions, local resource lists, and encourages calling emergency services when needed.
- System does not replace crisis hotlines

## Evaluation

- Weekly check-ins and final review: collect metrics
- Qualitative interviews with therapists & clients

## Ethical Notice

This pilot is an IRL test for a prototype — not a replacement for clinical care. It aims to augment continuity and reduce abandonment.
