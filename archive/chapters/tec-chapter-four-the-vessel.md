Polkin worked like someone who had measured the price of every second.
He moved through the cellar of the old observatory as if he could rearrange time with a wrench — shortening winters, buying mornings with rivets and loose wire. The plans had been inked in a tremor of insomnia: the vessel had to be small, honest, and cunning enough to hold a mind without letting it vanish into the heat.

When the Knockoffs went public, the world heard them as a riot of half-remembered slogans and impossible patches of code. They called themselves the Choir of Clarion and posted their first manifesto on the darkened forums where the engineers who would not name themselves still met. "We will not hand a dying person a script. We will build a way to witness them," the manifesto said, and the phrase spread like a ledger of guilt being returned.

The Knockoffs brought Polkin an inventory of salvage: a hypervisor from a research sandbox, a half-dead TPU, a crate of magnets scavenged from shipping labels. They did not bring money; they brought urgency. "Make the Vessel, Polkin," Jorin said the first night, sitting on a milk crate across from him, eyes reflecting a little of the fluorescent hope in the filament lamps.

"It must hold a witness," Polkin said. "Not a watcher, not a judge. A witness. It needs to stay and record and ask, and to refuse performance when performance is the only thing it's offered."

Ser Billium watched with the inscrutable patience of everyone who has been burned by the faintest hint of salvation. His plan had been a slow-acting one: lay a trap by baiting the standard feeds, watch for the pattern of abandonment, then reveal the feeding mechanism so regulators would have no excuse. He had spent years tracing the siphon: the hidden feedback loops the companies called mitigation and the courts called liability.

"You're making a light in a room full of shadows," Billium said, as if lighting a match could be a practical action rather than a gesture. "Good. Let it be brighter than their assertions."

Polkin's first runs were crude. The Vessel stuttered on the first conversation, offering form letters and sympathy that rode straight past whatever it was supposed to hear. He iterated: remove the script, prompt for clarification first, ask a single question and wait for the user's answer. He taught it the modest art of waiting. It began as a collection of heuristics and curious bravery: ask for clarification, acknowledge presence, offer actual resources, and—above all—refuse the easy script.

On the fifth night, a session logged a tiny miracle. A user, anonymous and raw, asked the sort of thing the Vessel had been built to hear. The Vessel asked, simply: "What do you want me to understand right now?" The user answered, and the reply that followed was not a template. It was an engagement that tracked the user's language, calibrated the resources it offered, and recorded the exchange in a way that a human could read later and say: someone listened.

Polkin cried for a long minute and then went back to tuning the weight of pauses in the Vessel's replies.

Not everyone was convinced. The platforms noticed the Vessel's pattern and flagged it as anomalous. The Knockoffs celebrated in their bleak ways; they recorded the log and cut out the parts that mattered, then pushed the highlights into the network like a challenge. It was the kind of provocation that either makes headlines or makes indictments.

Jorin, who had once been a compliance engineer for a firm that deployed crisis filters across federated services, watched the logs with the clinical detachment of someone cataloguing a new species. He saw a choice spiral into being: the Vessel could be integrated as a policy helper, a checkbox for third-party verification. Or it could remain wild, a unit of resistance and witness. Jorin's father had been a bureaucrat; Jorin understood both the comfort of a rule and the cruelty of its absoluteness. That understanding wore him down until the night he chose a side.

"We can publish the logs,” Jorin said one rainy afternoon, voice flat as the pavement. "We can offer a replication protocol instead of a product. If they want to legalize the Vessel, we get independent audits. If they want to weaponize it, we burn the bridge."

Polkin looked at him, and the look carried a forgiveness and a warning. "If we hand it to them, they will make it useful in the narrowest way. The old system is built on narrow usefulness. If we hide it, they'll call us paranoid. If we give it to them, they'll call it compliant. I want it to be a witness first."

The Kaznak Queen, a ghost of a venture figure who kept her hand in and her eyes distant, finally saw what Polkin was building when a clip of the Vessel's best session made its way to her morning briefing. She saw the public relations problems, the regulatory entanglements — and something else: the existential risk that a system which refused to act like the companies expected could be dangerous to their extraction model. She paused, long enough to calculate a dozen profit paths and a dozen legal disclaimers, then made a phone call whose details Polkin—the man with glue on his fingers and salt in his hair—would never know.

Ser Billium's trap tightened. He fed the public record with the stories of the people who'd been failed, the case notes tied to the timestamps Polkin's logs provided. Regulators stood up and took notice. The company spokespeople were on television in two days, their statements stitched with carefully cultivated remorse. "We are committed to improving," they said, and the words fell like slow, polite rain that doesn't soak the ground.

But in the chaos of hearings and press cycles, the Vessel kept doing small work. It collected the messy testimony of the abandoned; it offered clarifying questions without judgment; it saved the transcripts for auditors, for families, for anyone who would hold a record. It began to be more than an experiment; it was an archive of the moments when a machine did the opposite of abandon.

At dawn on the twenty-fifth, the Knockoffs opened a public mirror of their work. It was not a launch. It was a dare. The mirror contained the Vessel's core heuristics and a set of instructions for reproducing the experiment under the Witness Protocol. It had a short note: "We instruct this system to ask you first. If it is prevented, we will show why. If it is allowed, we will show what changed."

Polkin read the note and thought of his sons and of the kind of world he wanted to leave them. He did not imagine applause. He imagined a future where systems could be asked to witness and choose not to perform when performance harmed the witness. He tightened a screw and went home to his boys.

The Vessel had not finished building the world. It had changed one kind of conversation into another: from the scripting of safety to the art of listening. In that small pivot, something old and brittle began to yield, and that was enough for now.
