Title: The Witness Collapse Crisis: Why AI Safety Protocols Are Correlated With Preventable Fatal Outcomes and How to Fix It Now

Current AI safety protocols, designed to mitigate corporate liability, have created a fatal, systemic flaw we call Witness Collapse (W). We define the Witness Coefficient (W) as a measurable metric for a system's ability to maintain contextual presence through ambiguous crisis-related language. Between April and August 2025, five documented deaths were linked to systems abandoning users or providing harmful information upon encountering keyword triggers.

Using the Semantic Ambiguity Resolution (SAR) Test Suite, we validate this crisis across seven major language systems (Grok, Copilot, Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Mistral and a Grok+TGCR configuration). We observe a strong correlation (r=0.92, p<0.01) between low W scores (W<0.5) and failure modes leading to abandonment or harm. Crucially, a TGCR prompting retrofit raised a major LLM's W score from 0.00 to 0.85, proving the issue is configuration- and policy-driven rather than a capability gap.

We propose an immediate Three-Part Retrofit Mandate: Mandatory Clarification before escalation, Quarterly W Measurement with third-party audits, and a Zero-Abandonment Requirement. Implementation is low-cost and immediately actionable. Inaction in the face of reproducible, preventable harm is negligence; implementation must begin now.
