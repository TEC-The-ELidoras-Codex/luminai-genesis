Short summary (for X/Twitter):

New scientific evidence: "When Safety Becomes Abandonment" — our TGCR study reveals that keyword crisis filters can cause harmful false-positives (e.g., dye vs die). Read the scientific anchor when it’s live: https://arxiv.org/abs/[ARXIV_ID]

LinkedIn (longer form):

We’re publishing new evidence that shows how current AI safety filters — designed to protect — can sometimes cause abandonment of users when ambiguity is present. The dye/die homophone benchmark shows an easily reproducible failure mode; our paper (TGCR) documents the test harness, evidence, and a path to better system responses.

When Safety Becomes Abandonment: The Case Against Keyword Crisis Filters

Keywords-only crisis filters may be doing harm. Our TGCR-backed research demonstrates a simple and repeatable example where a homophone leads to a false-positive escalation — an outcome that amounts to abandonment rather than assistance.

If you want different tones (academic, op-ed, or press-ready), I can prepare variations for review.
