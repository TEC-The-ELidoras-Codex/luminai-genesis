(# When “Safety” Becomes Abandonment: The Case Against Keyword Crisis Filters)

**Status (pinned):** The scientific anchor for this exposé is available as an OSF preprint (CC-BY 4.0): <https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/XQ3PE>

Lead/lede (for Substack/Medium):

When safety systems misunderstand us, they can abandon us. In our new study — The Theory of General Contextual Resonance (TGCR) — we show how simple keyword-only crisis filters can escalate ambiguous user language inappropriately, creating outcomes that look like abandonment rather than assistance. Read the full scientific anchor (OSF preprint): <https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/XQ3PE>

Summary (what to emphasize):

- The problem: Keyword-only crisis filters can produce false-positives that disconnect users in moments of need.
- The evidence: A small, reproducible benchmark (dye/die homophone tests) demonstrating how homophonic ambiguity triggers escalation.
- The solution path: TGCR provides an analytic framework and a test suite (SAR) to measure behavioral coherence and to design safer response policies.

Suggested excerpt (short):

When keyword-matching systems interpret ambiguous language as crisis intent, they risk abandoning users who need assistance. Our TGCR study provides both a theoretical framework and an actionable benchmark to detect and mitigate these failures. The scientific anchor is available at: <https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/XQ3PE>
