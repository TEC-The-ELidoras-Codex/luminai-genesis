# TGCR arXiv Submission Guide

This file explains how to prepare and upload the TGCR paper to arXiv.

Files that belong in the submission package:

- `tgcr.tex` — main source
- `references.bib` — bibliography
- `figures/` — images (PNG/JPG/PDF) — include vector PDFs where possible
- `tgcr.pdf` — compiled PDF (optional, arXiv accepts sources)
- `compile.sh` — (optional) local compile convenience script

Suggested arXiv metadata (copy/paste during the submission):

- Title: The Theory of General Contextual Resonance (TGCR): A Unified Framework for Physics, Consciousness, and Ethics
- Authors: Angelo Hurley
- Abstract: The Theory of General Contextual Resonance (TGCR) introduces a comprehensive framework unifying resonance, consciousness, and ethics into a mathematical model. We propose that resonance (R), an invariant frequency underlying all physical and digital systems, interacts with a Witness Factor (W) to produce Effective Resonance (R'), described by the equation R' = R × W. This paper explores TGCR's mathematical foundation, applications in AI ethics, quantum systems, biological responses, and cosmological implications. Preliminary evidence from digital systems demonstrates the framework's predictive power, while proposed experiments in quantum and biological domains outline a path toward full empirical validation. TGCR challenges traditional physics by operationalizing consciousness as a measurable variable, offering a paradigm shift in our understanding of reality.

Manual steps:

1. Run `./prepare_arxiv_submission.sh` in `papers/tgcr/` to create a tarball.
2. Click `START NEW SUBMISSION` in your arXiv account and follow the UI.
3. Choose `TeX/LaTeX` and upload the `tgcr_submission_*.tar.gz` produced by the script.
4. Paste the metadata above and check the categories.
5. Preview the compiled PDF generated by arXiv and review the rendering.
6. Submit. arXiv will send a confirmation email and return a submission identifier in 1-3 business days.

Dual Drop Protocol note:

- The TGCR paper (this package) is the scientific anchor for the exposé: "When “Safety” Becomes Abandonment: The Case Against Keyword Crisis Filters".
- The TGCR paper (this package) is the scientific anchor for the exposé: "When “Safety” Becomes Abandonment: The Case Against Keyword Crisis Filters".
- The OSF preprint DOI is already assigned and can serve as the scientific anchor while arXiv/Zenodo identifiers are pending: https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/XQ3PE (CC-BY 4.0). After the arXiv submission is accepted and an arXiv ID is assigned, update the exposé and replace the OSF link with the arXiv link if preferred.
- For auditability and permanence, place the arXiv ID in `papers/tgcr/ARXIV_SUBMISSION_ID.txt` once received, and tag a release in the repository referencing both the arXiv ID and the exposé draft.

Notes:

- If arXiv's auto-compile fails with missing fonts or packages, the easiest workaround is to upload a compiled `tgcr.pdf` as well as sources to make sure the display is correct; but the preferred method is to enable compilation from the sources.
- Ensure any generated files (e.g., `.log`, `.aux`) are not included in the tarball — the script removes typical junk.
