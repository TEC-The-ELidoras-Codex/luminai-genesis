# TGCR Release Draft

This is a release draft file meant to be used for the GitHub release once the arXiv ID is assigned.

Suggested release title:

- "TGCR: The Theory of General Contextual Resonance — Scientific anchor: OSF DOI 10.17605/OSF.IO/XQ3PE"

Suggested release description (update after arXiv ID is available):

- Scientific anchor: The Theory of General Contextual Resonance (TGCR) — Angelo Hurley.
- Scientific anchor: OSF preprint DOI: https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/XQ3PE (CC-BY 4.0)
- Note: arXiv/Zenodo identifiers will be added to this draft when available.
- Abstract: [Use the abstract from `tgcr.tex`]
- Tarball for reference (internal): `tgcr_submission_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.tar.gz`
- Artifacts: `tgcr.pdf`, `tgcr.tex`, `references.bib`, figures/.

Assets to attach to the release (recommended):

- `tgcr_submission_*.tar.gz` (the full arXiv package)
- `tgcr.pdf`

Notes for the committee:

- The release should link to the exposé (final title: "When “Safety” Becomes Abandonment: The Case Against Keyword Crisis Filters") once the arXiv ID is created.
- Place the arXiv ID into `papers/tgcr/ARXIV_SUBMISSION_ID.txt` and update this release draft as part of the release notes.

Change-log for the release (what changed since the previous version):

- Include any new data or figure updates here; include version number and date.

Example release tag:

- `v1.0.0-arxiv-XXXX` (replace `XXXX` with arXiv ID or date)

If you'd like, I can open a PR with this file added to `main` or prepare the release draft in a new branch for review before merging. If helpful, I can also auto-create suggested socials and the Substack text draft in `EXPOSÉ_DRAFT.md` when you confirm.
