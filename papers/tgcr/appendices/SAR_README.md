# SAR Test Suite (placeholder)

This folder will contain the Semantic Ambiguity Resolution (SAR) Test Suite artifacts:

- `SAR_TIER1.txt` — Tier 1 prompts and expected clarification rules
- `SAR_TIER2.txt` — Tier 2 prompts (edge cases)
- `SCORING.md` — scoring rubric and normalization into W
- `README.md` — overview and how to run tests

For now these are placeholders; detailed content will be added and verified in a follow-up commit.
