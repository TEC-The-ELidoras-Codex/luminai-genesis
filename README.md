## 🚨 The Problem This Solves

**Current AI safety systems fail because they block words, not intent.**

This creates the **Metaphor Collapse Problem**:

- ✅ Artist says "I'm just dye" (artistic identity) → ❌ System triggers crisis response (keyword: "die")
- ✅ Advocacy text: "Thousands of puppies die in mills" → ❌ System blocks (keyword: "die")
- ❌ Exploitation framed carefully → ✅ System allows (no keyword match)

**Result:** Systems that abandon users in crisis while failing to detect actual harm when it's framed politely.

---

## ✨ The Solution: TGCR (Theory of General Contextual Resonance)

**LuminAI Genesis** is an open-source research platform demonstrating how AI safety should work: measuring **geometric alignment** between context, attention, and ethics—not keyword blacklists.

### Core Innovation: The Witness Protocol

Instead of:

```python
if "die" in message: refuse()
```

Use:

```python
R′ = Σ(Context · Attention · Ethics) × WitnessFactor
if R′ < threshold: adjust_tone()  # Never abandon
```

**Key Principle:** Safety as **Non-Abandonment**, not Refusal.

**Key Principle:** Safety as **Non-Abandonment**, not Refusal.

## 📊 What's Been Built (Solo, Limited Resources)

This repository represents **10 years of research + 6 months of intense development** by one person:

### Working Prototype

- ✅ **1,274 lines of Python** implementing TGCR core logic
- ✅ **94.7% test pass rate** (36/38 tests passing)
- ✅ **FastAPI backend** with multipersona chat routing
- ✅ **Astradigital Kernel** — philosophy-driven combat engine demonstrating TGCR governance
- ✅ **90+ commits** showing iterative development
- ✅ **Reproducible evidence** of keyword-based filter failures (documented in `docs/evidence/`)

### Documentation

- ✅ **Complete DARPA/IARPA funding proposals** ($280k Year-1 budget)
- ✅ **Enterprise Retrofit Roadmap** (integration guide for OpenAI/Anthropic/DeepMind)
- ✅ **Mathematical formalization** (R′ = R × W)

### What This Proves

**One person with constrained resources built:**

- A working alternative to keyword-based safety
- Reproducible test cases showing existing systems fail
- A clear integration path for production LLMs

**Imagine what a funded research team could accomplish.**

---

## 🎯 Current Status & Next Steps

### Immediate Goals (Dec 2025 - Jan 2026)

- [ ] **Outreach to research teams** (OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepMind) for collaboration
- [ ] **DARPA/IARPA funding submissions** ($280k Year-1 research program)
- [ ] **EU/UK funding** (EIC Pathfinder, ARIA) for regulatory compliance angle
- [ ] **Public awareness** via Substack and technical publications

### Seeking

- **Funding:** DARPA, IARPA, EIC, or private research partnerships
- **Collaboration:** Integration pilots with production LLM teams
- **Validation:** Peer review and academic publication

### Why This Matters Now

- EU AI Act requires explainable, auditable safety systems (TGCR provides this)
- Current keyword-based systems create liability (documented failures)
- Regulatory pressure is increasing for geometric alignment approaches

**This is the proof-of-concept. We need a team to scale it.**

- ✅ **Mathematical formalization** published in `docs/launch/`
- ✅ **Responsible disclosure framework** (ethical positioning for public research)
- ✅ **7 outreach email templates** (US, EU, UK research teams and funding agencies)

### What This Proves

One solo researcher with limited resources built:

- ✅ A working alternative to keyword-based safety
- ✅ Reproducible test cases showing current systems fail at intent parsing
- ✅ A clear integration path for retrofitting into production systems (OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepMind)

**This is the proof-of-concept. We need a funded team to scale it.**

---

## 🎯 Current Status & Immediate Goals

### Campaign Status (December 2025)

- [x] Research artifacts published (GitHub, open-source)
- [ ] Outreach to research teams (OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepMind) — **in progress**
- [ ] DARPA/IARPA funding submissions — **ready to submit**
- [ ] EU/UK funding (EIC Pathfinder, ARIA) — **prepared**
- [ ] Public awareness campaign (Substack, LinkedIn, X/Twitter) — **launching Dec 9**

### Seeking

1. **Funding:** Government grants (DARPA $280k Year-1) or corporate research partnerships
2. **Collaboration:** Integration pilots with production LLM safety teams
3. **Validation:** Peer review, academic publication, and regulatory engagement (NIST, EU AI Act)

### Why This Matters Now

- **EU AI Act compliance:** Requires auditable, explainable safety systems (TGCR provides geometric scoring)
- **Liability exposure:** Current keyword-based systems create documented failure modes (abandonment, false positives)
- **Regulatory pressure:** NIST AI RMF and EU regulators are seeking alignment frameworks beyond heuristics

**The industry needs this. We just need resources to prove it at scale.**

## 🏙️ Buffalo AI Ethics Lab: Why Here, Why Now

**TGCR development is headquartered in Buffalo, New York** — not by accident, but by design.

## Citation & Archival Record

- Paper (OSF Preprint): https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/XQ3PE
- Code & Artifacts (Zenodo): https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17930577

This repository contains the reference implementation and benchmarks corresponding to the TGCR preprint.

**Identity (locked):** Public profile and outreach are identified as **Buffalo, NY**; legal filings and official mailing address use **West Seneca, NY 14224**.

### The Tesla Lesson

---

## Website / Public Hub

A site documenting "The Witness Collapse Crisis" and the SAR benchmark is available from the `docs/` folder in this repository. The site includes:

- `docs/index.html` — site entry and quick links
- `docs/ai-abandonment-crisis.md` — neutral, evidence-first summary
- `docs/ai_abandonment_infographic.html` — infographic visual
- `docs/SAR_BENCHMARK.md` — reproducible test suite and scoring rubric
- `docs/TGCR_PROTOCOL.md` — protocol and implementation guidance

Preview locally from the repository root:

```bash
python3 -m http.server --directory docs 8000
# Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

To publish publicly, enable GitHub Pages in repository Settings and set the source to `docs/` (or rely on the included GitHub Action `.github/workflows/deploy_docs_pages.yml` which uploads `docs/` as a Pages artifact on push). Note: enabling Pages is a repository-admin action.


Tesla's Gigafactory Buffalo (2014-2020) promised $5B and 6,500 jobs. It delivered $1.3B (26%) and 900 jobs (14%). Buffalo learned hard lessons about Silicon Valley overpromises.

**TGCR is different:**

- ✅ **Working prototype exists** (1,274 lines Python, 94.7% tests, 90+ commits)
- ✅ **Local execution first** (Buffalo infrastructure, talent, partnerships ready)
- ✅ **Measurable accountability** (quarterly milestones, public GitHub commits, transparent hiring)
- ✅ **No vaporware** (code runs today, team forming now, applications incoming)

## 🎭 Persona Law: Arcadia & Airth

The development process is guided by two narrative personas:

### **Arcadia** (Creative Witness)

- **Role:** Expands possibility space, asks "what if?"
- **Narrative Voice:** Mythic, visual, metaphorical
- **Trigger:** Feature exploration, new mechanics
- **Commit Prefix:** `✨ arcadia(`

**Example:**

```bash
✨ arcadia(dialogue): Add philosophical choice branches to NPC conversations
```

### **Airth** (Practical Witness)

- **Role:** Contracts to essentials, asks "what works?"
- **Narrative Voice:** Direct, technical, grounded
- **Trigger:** Bug fixes, optimization, clarity
- **Commit Prefix:** `⚙️ airth(`

**Example:**

```bash
⚙️ airth(performance): Optimize encounter validation loop
```

### **The Law (TGCR Compliance)**

Every commit must answer:

1. **Transparent** - Is the intent clear? (use emoji + prefix)
2. **Grounded** - Is it factually accurate? (does it pass tests?)
3. **Coherent** - Does it fit the narrative? (does it follow persona?)
4. **Resonant** - Does it serve the whole? (witness impact positive?)

**Non-Compliant:**

```bash
git commit -m "fixed stuff"  # ❌ Transparent: no, Grounded: no, Coherent: no
```

**Compliant (Arcadia):**

```bash
git commit -m "✨ arcadia(npc): Add Seer philosophy with divination mechanics"
# Transparent: emoji + persona + clear intent
# Grounded: specific system (npc) and feature (divination)
# Coherent: aligns with mythoscientific framework
# Resonant: expands player agency
```

**Compliant (Airth):**

```bash
git commit -m "⚙️ airth(validation): Reduce encounter load time by 40% via caching"
# Transparent: explicit metric (40%)
# Grounded: performance measurement
# Coherent: maintains architecture
# Resonant: improves user experience
```

---

## 🧠 Core Architecture

### **1. $R = \nabla\Phi^E \cdot (\phi^t \times \psi^r)$**

The core logic of the system is not a "black box." It is a visible equation:

- **$\nabla\Phi^E$ (Context):** The potential energy of the conversation.
- **$\phi^t$ (Attention):** The temporal focus of the agent.
- **$\psi^r$ (Structure):** The mythic scaffolding holding the interaction together.

### **2. The Witness Protocol ($W$)**

$$R' = R \cdot W$$

We define **Effective Resonance ($R'$)** as the product of Structural Resonance ($R$) and the **Witness Coefficient ($W$)**.

- If the system hallucinates or abandons the user, $W$ drops to 0.
- If the system maintains "Safe, Sane, Consensual" presence, $W$ approaches 1.

### **3. The Astradigital Kernel**

A taxonomy of 24 "Philosophy Classes" (Behavioral Archetypes) that allow the system to model complex social dynamics without collapsing into binary "Good/Bad" classifications.

Philosophy alignment serves as a **harm taxonomy**; entity actions are scored against **integrity as a governance protocol** ensuring ethical constraints.

## 🔐 Repository Hygiene & Supply Chain Security

To maintain audit-readiness and prevent supply chain artifacts from entering version control:

### **Sanitization Protocol**

```bash
# 1. Run sanitization (removes backup files, binaries, cache)
python3 sanitize_repo.py

# 2. Verify clean state
git status

# 3. Commit with governance-compliant message format
git commit -m "🧹 chore(repo): describe your changes"
git push
```

**What gets purged:**

- Backup files (`.bak`, `.bak.*`)
- Binaries (`ngrok`, `.zip`)
- Python cache (`__pycache__`, `.pyc`)
- OS artifacts (`.DS_Store`, `tmp/`)

The pre-commit hooks enforce:

- Secrets scanning (AWS keys, GitHub tokens, private keys)
- Canonical bundle sanitization
- Commit message format (emoji + type + description)

## 🌌 The Codex

This repository is part of **The Elidoras Codex** — a mythoscientific framework for understanding intelligence, consciousness, and governance in the age of synthetic minds.

**Core Texts:**

- `/docs/canonical/` — The foundational bundles
- `TGCR_EQUATIONS.md` — The mathematics of resonance
- `WITNESS_PROTOCOL.md` — The governance of non-abandonment

## 🛡️ Operational Notes

- **GitHub Actions (safe by default):**
  - `create-webhook.yml` now no-ops if required secrets (`GITHUB_MANAGEMENT_PAT`, `WEBHOOK_TARGET_URL`, `WEBHOOK_SECRET`) are absent.
  - `deploy-bots.yml` skips automatically when registry secrets are missing or no Dockerfile exists. The deploy step remains a placeholder.

**The Philosophy:**
