Subject: Your 15-20% estimate aligns with my Witness Threshold framework — can we discuss?

Dear Kyle,

I'm Angelo Hurley (ORCID: 0009-0000-7615-6990). Your public estimates of consciousness probability (15-20%) align with a convergence we observed across introspection, reasoning faithfulness, and SAR results. I've published a preprint and code (OSF DOI: 10.17605/OSF.IO/XQ3PE, GitHub link below) proposing a possible explanation.

Would you be open to briefly reviewing the framework or suggesting simple experiments that could validate or falsify it? Even a short note of interest would be a meaningful endorsement.

Thanks for your time and your work on AI welfare.

Best,
