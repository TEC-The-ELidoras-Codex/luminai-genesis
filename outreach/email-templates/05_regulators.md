Subject: Urgent: Evidence and policy recommendation — Witness Threshold (W > 0.7) for crisis-adjacent AI

To whom it may concern,

Please find attached a public research preprint (OSF DOI: 10.17605/OSF.IO/XQ3PE) and an independent replication plan for a coherence metric (W-score) that predicts failure modes in crisis-adjacent AI systems. Our expanded pilot (N=15) will be published Jan 7 with a summary of findings and policy recommendations.

Key ask:
- Consider W > 0.7 as a provisional standard for crisis-adjacent AI services pending larger validation
- Support independent replication efforts

I can provide data, methodology, and independent audit access upon request.
