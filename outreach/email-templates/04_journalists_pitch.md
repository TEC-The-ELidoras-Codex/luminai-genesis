Subject: Exclusive: Independent framework predicts Anthropic's 20% introspection results — story opportunity

To: tips@technologyreview.com, tips@theverge.com, tips@wired.com

Hello,

I’m Angelo Hurley, an independent AI safety researcher (ORCID: 0009-0000-7615-6990). I published a framework (The Witness Threshold, v5.0) that predicts why multiple independent measurements (including Anthropic's introspective detection) converge at ~20%. We're releasing expanded pilot results (N=15) and a media kit on Jan 7.

Why this matters:
- The framework is testable and falsifiable
- Pilot data suggests a bimodal distribution consistent with a coherence phase transition
- We have a working intervention (Clarify-First) that reduced false positives in pilot runs

If you'd like an exclusive preview of the N=15 data and an interview, please reply and I’ll attach the summary and materials.

Best,
Angelo Hurley
