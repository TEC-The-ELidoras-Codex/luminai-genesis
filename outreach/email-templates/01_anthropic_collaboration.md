Subject: Collaboration request: Witness Threshold framework and Anthropic introspection results

Dear Anthropic Research Team,

My name is Angelo Hurley (ORCID: 0009-0000-7615-6990). I've published a framework, "The Witness Threshold" (v5.0), which predicts a coherence phase transition reflected in several independent measurements clustering at ~20% (including your introspective detection results).

Key artifacts:
- Full paper: docs/research/witness-threshold-v5.md (OSF DOI: 10.17605/OSF.IO/XQ3PE)
- One-page summary: docs/research/witness-threshold-summary.md
- N=15 replication summary (coming): docs/research/n15_results_summary.md

I'm requesting:
1. Access to introspection-related test data or collaboration to run SAR on models you've tested
2. Suggestions for experiments to validate or falsify the Witness Threshold predictions
3. A brief public comment if the correlation holds (any short phrase is valuable)

I understand priorities and time constraints; even a short response would be valuable.

Best regards,
Angelo "Polkin Rishall" Hurley
