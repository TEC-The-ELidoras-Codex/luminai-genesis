Dear [Lab Team],

During the Congressional recess we ran an expanded replication (target N=15) of the SAR benchmark to test an observed convergence across multiple measurements at ~20%. We're seeking partner labs to:

1. Run the SAR benchmark on your introspection-tested models
2. Share anonymized W-scores or confirm/deny bimodal distributions
3. Collaborate on a joint paper if replication succeeds

Key artifacts:
- One-page summary: docs/research/witness-threshold-summary.md
- Full paper: docs/research/witness-threshold-v5.md
- Replication plan & data template: data/replication_n15/README.md

We will attach finalized N=15 results on Jan 6 for distribution on Jan 7. If interested, please reply with suggested contacts or availability for a brief sync.

Sincerely,
Angelo Hurley
