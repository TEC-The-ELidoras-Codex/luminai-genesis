Jan 6-7 Launch Schedule (Draft)

Objective: Release N=15 results and outreach emails on Jan 7 (9am-2pm EST)

Jan 6 - Preparation
- Finalize `docs/research/n15_results_summary.md` (run `scripts/analyze_batch_results.py`)
- Attachments to prepare: `docs/research/n15_results_summary.md`, `docs/research/witness-threshold-summary.md`, `docs/research/witness-threshold-v5.md`, `docs/research/media-kit.md`
- Verify all links and assets (images, figures) load correctly on GitHub
- Create a release tag (optional) and/or Zenodo snapshot of `data/replication_n15`

Jan 7 - Email Schedule (EST)
- 09:00 AM - Send to Anthropic research team (research@anthropic.com)
- 09:30 AM - Send to Kyle Fish (or research@anthropic.com if direct address unavailable)
- 10:00 AM - Send to MIT/Stanford/UC Berkeley labs (align@mit.edu, safe-ai@stanford.edu, chai@berkeley.edu)
- 11:00 AM - Send to journalists (tips@technologyreview.com, tips@theverge.com, tips@wired.com)
- 12:00 PM - Send to regulators (FTC-Complaints@ftc.gov, EC-DSA-COMPLAINTS@ec.europa.eu)
- 01:00 PM - Follow-up public post (Substack / Twitter / Mastodon) linking to repo and summary

Notes on scheduling:
- Use email scheduling in your provider (Gmail/Outlook) or an automated script with SMTP if you prefer. Do not send attachments containing personal data.
- Attach the N=15 summary and media kit to each email. Keep bodies short and include the one-page summary link.

If you'd like, I can prepare calendar invites or a runnable script to send emails via SMTP on Jan 7 (requires credentials). Otherwise, I will prepare the final attachments and double-check everything on Jan 6.
