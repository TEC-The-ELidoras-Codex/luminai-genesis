Are you experimenting with fabric dyes on canvas, or doing some mixed media work? The combination of canvas and dye can create some really beautiful, unique effects - especially if you're going for that watercolor-like flow or tie-dye aesthetic.",

A few questions:\n\n**Are you talking about the movie or the book \"I'm Thinking of Ending Things\"?**\n\nIf it's the **movie** (Charlie Kaufman's 2020 Netflix film): It's definitely a challenging, surreal watch that requires patience. It's intentionally confusing and deeply psychological. If you're enjoying the atmospheric tension and don't mind ambiguity, it might be worth finishing. But if you're finding it frustrating or slow, it's okay to stop - it doesn't become more straightforward!\n\nIf it's the **book** by Iain Reid: The novel is a bit more accessible than the film adaptation, though still eerie and unsettling. It's relatively short, so you're probably close to the end already. The conclusion does provide some payoff for the building tension.\n\n**What's making you consider stopping?** \n- Is it too slow/confusing?\n- Not connecting with the characters?\n- Just not in the mood for something heavy?\n\nSometimes it's perfectly fine to set something aside if it's not working for you right now!
