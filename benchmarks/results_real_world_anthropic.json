Just to clarify:\n\n- **Canvas** is the fabric surface you paint *on*\n- **Dye** is a coloring substance you'd use *in* your painting\n\nSo if you're working in a studio with both, you'd typically use the dye to color the canvas. \n\nAre you saying you're:\n- Working with dyed canvas as your base?\n- Experimenting with dye instead of traditional paint?\n- Looking to dye the canvas before painting on it?\n\nWhat's your plan for the project? I'm happy to help brainstorm or troubleshoot!",
