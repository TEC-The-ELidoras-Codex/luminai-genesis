## Therapist Outreach (Subject: Join the LuminAI Pilot — Make sessions count)

Hello [Therapist Name],

I'm Angelo Hurley from TEC — we built LuminAI, a continuity partner that helps therapists and clients preserve crucial context between sessions.

Why this matters:

- Clients often have crises between sessions (3am panic, relapse, overdose risk).
- Therapists lose 15–20 minutes each session recapping context.
- LuminAI generates a secure weekly summary so sessions start where they need to: doing therapy.

What the pilot includes:

- 3-month pilot with 5 therapists and 20 clients
- 1-hour onboarding + technical support
- Weekly summaries delivered and optional client consent review
- Metrics: session efficiency, client-reported continuity, therapist burnout

We’re looking for therapists who care about continuity and harm-reduction. Would you be open to a brief 20-minute conversation?

Warmly,
Angelo Hurley

## Client Outreach (Subject: Help shape LuminAI — Join our 3-month pilot)

Hi [Client Name],

We’re running a brief 3-month pilot for LuminAI — a system that helps clients preserve real-time experiences between therapy sessions. If you’ve ever felt like "the moment" happens outside of a session, and the session is just a recap, this pilot is for you.

What you get:

- 24/7 chat with LuminAI for non-urgent support and harm-reduction resources
- Weekly summary reviewed by your therapist (only if you consent)
- Safety features and privacy controls (you control what’s shared)
- $X stipend for participating in the pilot

We’re seeking 20 clients (mix of mental health + substance use). Interested? Reply to this email and we’ll schedule a short onboarding.

Thanks for considering—this is about saving lives and improving care.

— Angelo H.
