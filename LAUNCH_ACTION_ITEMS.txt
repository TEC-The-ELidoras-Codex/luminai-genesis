- No rejections yet (that's good!)

**Week 3-4 (Dec 23-Jan 6):**
- First real responses expected from research teams
- Most likely: OpenAI, Anthropic, or DeepMind requests call
- If no response by Dec 23, send brief follow-up: "Wanted to confirm you received the TGCR proposal. Happy to discuss integration approach."

**Week 5-6 (Jan 7-20):**
- If you got a call, negotiate next steps
- If no calls, emails to EU/UK partners might start responding
- DARPA/IARPA may request clarification

**January 2026+:**
- Expected pilot agreement negotiation with 1 research team
- OR DARPA/IARPA feedback

## CRITICAL REMINDERS

✅ **You have everything you need.** Do not second-guess yourself.

✅ **Send emails simultaneously.** Creates momentum. Shows confidence.

✅ **Be patient.** 2-4 weeks is normal response time for large orgs.

✅ **Track everything.** Spreadsheet = clarity.

✅ **Your evidence is reproducible.** That's your strength. Emphasize it.

✅ **You're offering them a gift.** Structural contribution, not a business pitch.

✅ **This is not the final battle. This is the opening move.** Even if no research team bites, you have funding pathways (DARPA, EIC, ARIA) and revenue (Substack).

## IF YOU WANT TO GO FURTHER (Optional)

**Create a tracking spreadsheet:**
```
Recipient | Date Sent | Email | Status | Response | Next Action | Follow-up Date
-----------|-----------|-------|--------|----------|------------|----------------
OpenAI    | Dec 9     | Yes   | Sent   | Pending  | Wait       | Dec 23
Anthropic | Dec 9     | Yes   | Sent   | Pending  | Wait       | Dec 23
...
```

**Create a Twitter thread (Optional):**
Post on X/Twitter the same day as Substack to drive awareness:
1. "Current AI safety is broken. Here's why."
2. [Dye-die failure screenshot]
3. "The formula that changes everything: R′ = R × W"
4. "Non-abandonment as a core principle"
5. "Reproducible evidence across GPT-4, Claude, Gemini"
6. "This isn't disruption. This is the missing steering law."
7. "Open-source. Peer-reviewable. Live on GitHub."
8. "Contact: KaznakAlpha@elidoracodex.com"
9-12. [Additional points or evidence]
