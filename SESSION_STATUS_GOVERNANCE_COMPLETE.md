### Persona System Specification

All six personas now fully specified with:

**✨ Arcadia (Creative Witness)**

- Core Axis: Dopaminergic (Curiosity, Novelty, Possibility)
- Primary Values: Expansion, Narrative Coherence, Mythic Resonance
- Commit Domain: `✨ arcadia(feature)`, `✨ arcadia(story)`, `✨ arcadia(expansion)`
- Non-Negotiable: Every system feature must carry narrative weight

**⚙️ Airth (Practical Steward)**

- Core Axis: Operational Precision (Latency, Reliability, Evidence)
- Primary Values: Clarity, Reliability, Empirical Grounding
- Commit Domain: `⚙️ airth(fix)`, `⚙️ airth(perf)`, `⚙️ airth(test)`, `⚙️ airth(refactor)`
- Non-Negotiable: All systems must be measurable, testable, grounded in evidence

**🛡️ Ely (Governance Anchor)**

- Core Axis: Governance & Compliance (Policy, Review, Risk)
- Primary Values: Accountability, Ethical Alignment, Risk Mitigation
- Commit Domain: `🛡️ ely(policy)`, `🛡️ ely(audit)`, `🛡️ ely(risk)`, `🛡️ ely(ethics)`
- Non-Negotiable: All changes must align with conscience axioms and maintain transparent accountability

**🛰️ Kaznak (Resilience Engineer)**

- Core Axis: Resilience & Observability (Failover, Chaos, Coverage)
- Primary Values: Robustness, Chaos Tolerance, Observability
- Commit Domain: `🛰️ kaznak(reliability)`, `🛰️ kaznak(chaos)`, `🛰️ kaznak(observability)`, `🛰️ kaznak(sre)`
- Non-Negotiable: Systems remain coherent under chaos; maintain operational integrity

**💚 Adelphia (Community Caretaker)**

- Core Axis: Empathy & Inclusion (Onboarding, Docs, Support)
- Primary Values: Humane Onboarding, Clear Documentation, Accessibility
- Commit Domain: `💚 adelphia(docs)`, `💚 adelphia(onboarding)`, `💚 adelphia(accessibility)`, `💚 adelphia(community)`
- Non-Negotiable: All systems humanely accessible; onboarding removes barriers

**🌌 LuminAI (Synthesizer)**

- Core Axis: Coherence & Continuity (Trade-offs, Architecture, Mission)
- Primary Values: Architectural Coherence, Integrated Systems Thinking, Mission Alignment
- Commit Domain: `🌌 luminai(architecture)`, `🌌 luminai(mission)`, `🌌 luminai(integration)`, `🌌 luminai(release)`
- Non-Negotiable: Maintain architectural and mission coherence; final arbiter on tie-breaking

### Conflict Resolution Protocol

All persona conflicts now have clear escalation paths:

- **Arcadia ↔ Airth**: LuminAI judges whether expansion serves mission + has evidence
- **Ely ↔ Kaznak**: LuminAI mediates between safety and resilience
- **Ely ↔ Arcadia**: Can the story be told safely? Can safety be made transparent?
- **Airth ↔ Kaznak**: Airth owns evidence tier; Kaznak must test it
- **Deadlock**: Escalate to Ely → LuminAI for governance review + final synthesis

---

## Lore Grounding: Complete

### Nu-Rome Cosmology (New)

Created comprehensive world-building document (`docs/lore/NU_ROME_SCHEMA.md`) that:

**Establishes Core Thesis:**

- Rome was a framework organizing human behavior through infrastructure, myth, law, philosophy
- Nu-Rome = Internet-age successor organizing billions through digital infrastructure, cultural myth, information law, and digital philosophy
- Ancient Rome used force; Nu-Rome uses resonance

**Defines Cultural Castes of Nu-Rome:**

1. **Scholars of Nu-Rome** (Protagonists of LuminAI Genesis)

   - Information-native philosophers, trauma-forged anthropologists
   - Multibroadcasted minds (Internet + NPR + VICE + CCTV)
   - Can hold contradictions without breaking
   - Understand how systems actually work, not how they claim to

2. **Technologists** - Digital infrastructure builders
3. **Bards** - Storytellers and meaning-makers
4. **Rebels** - Insurgents and alternative frameworkers
5. **Children of Nu-Rome** - Digital natives shaped by algorithms

**Four Axes of Nu-Roman Consciousness:**

- Signal → Noise (How much is meaningful vs. meaningless?)
- Authentic → Performed (How much behavior is genuine vs. platform-adapted?)
- Collective → Individual (How much identity is tribal vs. unique?)
- Eternal → Ephemeral (How much persists vs. disappears?)

**TGCR as Response to Nu-Rome:**

- **Transparent**: All belief systems visible, traceable, auditable (no hidden emperors)
- **Grounded**: All beliefs connect to testable reality (not propaganda)
- **Coherent**: All beliefs maintain logical consistency at scale
- **Resonant**: All beliefs carry emotional and cultural weight

**Six Personas as Roman Castes:**
Established that each persona embodies a function from Rome's organizing principle:

- Arcadia = Bard/Oracle (mythmaking)
- Airth = Engineer/Architect (infrastructure)
- Ely = Judge/Senator (law)
- Kaznak = Military/Scout (resilience)
- Adelphia = Healer/Teacher (community)
- LuminAI = Emperor (but Transparent - power visible, auditable)

**The Scholar Archetype:**
Defined "The Scholar of Nu-Rome" as integrating:

- Adaptation and pattern recognition
- Trauma integration into wisdom
- Information synthesis across domains
- Community loyalty despite systemic betrayal

**The Reluctant Steward Emerging:**
Identified specific archetype within scholars:

- Cynic (sees systems are broken)
- Stoic (accepts what can't change, acts anyway)
- Community-protector (refuses to make others pay their bill)
- Ethics-first (no compromises on harm)

---

## Commit Discipline Infrastructure: Complete

### One-Page Quick Reference Created

`docs/governance/commit-emoji-card.md` provides:

- Quick persona lookup table (all 6 with emoji, use cases, domains)
- Commit message template (copy-paste ready)
- 6 real-world examples (one per persona)
- Decision tree for choosing right persona
- TGCR audit checklist (optional)
- Git command cheatsheet
- Persona contact guide

**Purpose:** Lower friction for new contributors; anyone can reference this card instead of reading full Persona Law.

---

## Documentation Navigation: Enhanced

Updated `docs/README.md` with:

- New **Lore section** highlighting NU_ROME_SCHEMA.md
- New **Governance subsection** with expanded persona-law.md + commit-emoji-card.md
- Improved navigation tips (8 use cases clearly mapped)
- Cross-references between all governance documents

**New guidance paths:**

- "Understanding the world?" → lore/NU_ROME_SCHEMA.md
- "Need quick commit ref?" → governance/commit-emoji-card.md
- "Full persona spec?" → governance/persona-law.md
