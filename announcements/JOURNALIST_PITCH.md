# Journalist Pitch — TGCR

Subject: AI safety benchmark blocked from academic review — here's the data

Hi [Name],

I'm Angelo Hurley, creator of the Theory of General Contextual Resonance (TGCR) and the Semantic Ambiguity Resolution (SAR) benchmark for AI safety systems.

We attempted to submit TGCR to arXiv and were blocked due to endorsement requirements before any technical review occurred. The paper documents reproducible failures in major AI systems (ChatGPT, Claude, Grok, Gemini) when handling ambiguous crisis-adjacent language. The benchmark is public, the code is open-source, and the data is independently verifiable.

Paper: https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/XQ3PE
Code: https://github.com/TEC-The-ELidoras-Codex/luminai-genesis
Video demo: https://youtu.be/cBiLbihihP8

Would you be interested in covering this? I can provide raw logs, video capture, and step-by-step replication instructions.

Best,

Angelo Hurley
