Are you doing fabric dyeing techniques on the canvas, or using traditional dyes in a painting style? The combination of canvas and dye can create some really beautiful, organic effects - especially if you're doing any tie-dye, dip-dye, or resist techniques.\n\nWhat colors are you playing with?",

Both are pretty mind-bending in their own ways.\n\nThe movie is definitely one of those experiences that leaves you sitting there after the credits roll, trying to piece everything together. Very atmospheric and unsettling. The book is a bit more straightforward (though still creepy!) but hits differently.\n\nWhich one are you working through? And more importantly - how are you finding it so far? It's definitely the kind of story that benefits from talking through what's happening! 🎬📖",
