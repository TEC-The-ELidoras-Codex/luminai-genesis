## Project Title

LuminAI: Continuity Engine for Clinical Presence

## Objective

Pilot the TGCR Witness Protocol to evaluate whether context-first continuity substantially improves clinical relevance and reduces time-to-intervention for high-urgency events.

## Aims

1. Implement a v0 continuity engine for 100 pilot users with clinician opt-in.
2. Measure fidelity of captured events and clinician-rated usefulness of weekly summaries.
3. Validate escalation workflows in simulated and consented real-world incidents.

## Methods

- Recruitment: licensed therapists + consenting clients (n≈100 pairs).
- Instrumentation: mobile client + web portal; weekly therapist summaries, event-level explainers.
- Outcomes: clinician-rated actionability, time-to-intervention for triggered events, user acceptability.

## Budget (sketch)

- Engineering (3 months): $30k
- Clinical coordination: $15k
- IRB & legal: $5k
- Infrastructure & hosting: $5k
- Total (pilot): ~$55k

## Timeline

- Month 0–1: prototype + IRB
- Month 2: pilot onboarding
- Month 3: pilot execution + analysis
