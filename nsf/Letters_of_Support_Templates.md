To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to express my strong support for Angelo Hurley and the proposed TGCR Witness Protocol project. The SAR Benchmark and preliminary LuminAI Genesis prototype represent an important step toward measurable, auditable safety metrics for interactive AI systems. I believe TGCR has significant potential to improve safety outcomes in healthcare and transportation and to contribute directly to standards work. I am available to provide technical advice and to serve as an advisor if requested.

Sincerely,
