This folder previously contained the LuminAI Manifesto and core thesis.

We've migrated the manifesto content to `docs/lore/manifesto/` for clearer organization. For backwards compatibility, this README points to the new location.

Primary content now lives at:

- docs/lore/manifesto/CORE_THESIS.md
- docs/lore/manifesto/THE_ETHICAL_TROJAN.md

If you maintain internal references to `docs/manifesto/`, please update them to the new location to avoid future confusion.
