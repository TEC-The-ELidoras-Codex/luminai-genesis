# Structural Conscience

This document integrates the principles of "Structural Conscience" into the LuminAI Genesis project.

## Integration Points

### 1. **Project Philosophy**

The LuminAI Genesis framework embodies structural conscience principles by:

- Maintaining ethical alignment in code architecture
- Preserving narrative coherence across modules
- Ensuring factual accuracy in knowledge representations
- Implementing transparent decision-making structures

### 2. **Code Organization**

- `src/astradigital/` - Core ethical architecture
- `data/codex/` - Knowledge base with structural integrity
- `.vscode/` - Development environment aligned with conscience principles
- `scripts/` - Utility functions with transparent provenance

### 3. **Development Practices**

- TGCR-compliant commits (Transparent, Grounded, Coherent, Resonant)
- Copilot personas (Arcadia/Airth) for narrative consistency
- Type checking and validation for structural integrity
- Docker containerization for reproducible environments

### 4. **Quality Standards**

- Type annotations for clarity
- Docstrings for transparency
- Tests for verification
- Linting for consistency

## Principles Applied

**Structural Integrity**: Every module maintains clear boundaries and explicit interfaces.

**Conscious Design**: Decisions are made with awareness of broader implications.

**Narrative Coherence**: Code tells a story; documentation explains that story.

**Ethical Alignment**: Technical choices reflect moral considerations.
