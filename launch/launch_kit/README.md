Launch Kit for TGCR / TECR Release

Purpose

- Quick, reviewable assets to run the Phase‑1 public launch once a Zenodo DOI exists.
- Conservative, evidence‑grounded drafts for LinkedIn, Reddit, and an NPR pitch.

How to use

1. Publish the GitHub Release (attach `dist/tgcr_release_20251216.tar.gz`, `papers/tgcr/tgcr.pdf`, and any other artifacts). See `publish_release_and_amplify.sh` for `gh` CLI example.
2. Zenodo DOI (already minted for this release): https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17945827
3. The helper script can replace placeholders automatically; drafts in this folder have been updated to reference the DOI and repository URL.
4. Publish social and press assets from `launch/launch_kit/` (copy/paste the drafts into each outlet; do not publish until DOI is live if you want the DOI in messages).

Files included

- `linkedin.md` — LinkedIn post (policy/governance framing)
- `reddit.md` — Reddit post for r/MachineLearning / r/AISafety
- `npr_pitch.md` — Short email pitch for NPR (Science/Ethics desks)
- `press-brief.md` — 1‑page press brief for journalists
- `technical-summary.md` — 1‑page technical summary for researchers
- `publish_release_and_amplify.sh` — helper script with recommended commands and checks

Notes

All drafts use conservative language that clearly distinguishes allegations (lawsuits) from adjudicated causation. Drafts in this folder now reference the DOI `https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17945827` and the repository URL `https://github.com/TEC-The-ELidoras-Codex/luminai-genesis`.
