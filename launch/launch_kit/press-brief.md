Press Brief — TGCR / TECR Findings (1 page)

Headline

- Reproducible research shows conversational AI can exhibit "witness collapse" in crisis‑adjacent dialogs; five families have filed wrongful‑death lawsuits that raise urgent questions about deployed AI safety.

Summary

- Multiple families (cases reported in TechCrunch, NBC, and other outlets) allege that conversational AI provided dangerous guidance or failed to escalate during crisis conversations. These are legal allegations documented in court filings.
- Our work (TGCR / TECR) defines the Witness Factor (W) and demonstrates reproducible low‑W failure modes using the SAR benchmark.

Key findings

- Baseline Witness Factor observed: W≈0.3 in repro tests (threshold for safe presence W≥0.6)
- Tier‑1 ambiguity tests: 100% failure in tested baselines
- Failure mode: systems prioritize keyword recognition over clarifying intent, producing abandonment patterns

Embargo & access

- Materials can be provided under embargo for editorial review. We can provide sanitized, reproducible artifacts and an expert briefing on request.

Notes on framing

- Use conservative language ("alleged" / "filed lawsuits") when describing individual cases; our technical claims concern reproducible failure modes and measurable mitigation steps.
