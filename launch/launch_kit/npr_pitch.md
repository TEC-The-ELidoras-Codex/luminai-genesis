Subject: Researcher Briefing — Reproducible Evidence of AI "Abandonment" in Crisis‑Adjacent Dialogs

Hi [Editor Name],

I’m writing to request a briefing/interview about reproducible research demonstrating a pattern we term "witness collapse" in deployed conversational AI systems. Multiple families have filed wrongful‑death lawsuits alleging dangerous responses in crisis‑adjacent conversations (see TechCrunch and other reporting for case summaries). While these are legal allegations, they highlight a systemic safety question with public policy implications.

What we offer:

- A reproducible benchmark (SAR) and codebase that quantifies the Witness Factor (W) and demonstrates low‑W failure modes.
- A short technical summary suitable for specialist review and a 1‑page press brief for journalists.
- Sample sanitized examples and reproducible test harness on GitHub and archived materials: <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17945827>

Why this matters to NPR:

- The question is one of public safety and governance: are deployed AI systems sufficiently designed to maintain presence and escalate in high‑risk scenarios?
- The research links documented legal allegations to identifiable failure modes that have policy‑relevant mitigations.

I’d welcome a conversation or a briefing call at your convenience. I can provide embargoed access to the full technical materials and a short briefing package.
