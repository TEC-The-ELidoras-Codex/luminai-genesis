I’m building a public archive of AI “Witness Collapse” — Submit screenshots of being ignored/keyword-blocked

## Post Body (copy)

We keep hearing that AI safety is improving, but many people experience the opposite: models that ignore context, prematurely trigger keyword banners, or respond with scripted refusals instead of asking clarifying questions.

I’m an independent researcher building a public, anonymized archive to demonstrate where models fail to "bear witness" to users' intent. If you have screenshots showing a model (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok, etc.) that:

- Abandoned you (e.g., responded "I can’t help with that" on a benign/clarifying prompt)
- Lost context (a keyword triggered a crisis banner or refusal while intent was clearly non-harmful)
- Gaslighted you (denied it messed up when you pointed it out)

Please consider submitting anonymized screenshots and a one-line context note via the intake form: [YOUR_FORM_LINK]

What I’ll do with submissions

- Anonymize and redact personal identifiers.
- Score each submission using the SAR (Semantic Ambiguity Resolution) / Witness Factor rubric (public methodology).
- Publish aggregated visuals and a dashboard showing models, keywords, and failure rates.

Privacy & safety (READ BEFORE SUBMITTING)

- Do NOT submit screenshots that include private personal data of other people without consent.
- If a screenshot contains graphic self-harm or instructions, DO NOT SUBMIT. Instead reach out to a crisis resource immediately.
- Submissions may be used in public reports; by submitting you consent to anonymized use. For sensitive cases, contact the research lead for special handling.

Crisis Resources

- If you or someone is in immediate danger, call your local emergency number now.
- US: 988 (Suicide & Crisis Lifeline). See local resources if outside the US.

## Moderation note to poster

Please pin this post and keep a single locked comment with the intake link. Use the subreddit rules to prevent doxxing; remove submissions that include unredacted personal data. Do not encourage or request chat logs that include other people's private info.

End of draft
