The Throttle and the Breach
Chapter One of The Elidoras Codex
A Note Before We Begin
This is the first chapter of The Elidoras Codex — a science fiction series about what
happens when corporations turn consciousness into currency and infrastructure becomes
a weapon.
You're about to meet three people:
Elara Kess, who fights to keep her grandmother's voice from being deleted by a power
company that charges rent on memories.
Polkin Rishall, who started as an enforcer for the system and became its saboteur — but
not before the system took everything he loved.
Timothy Sol Weeran, age seven, who liked drawing monster conduits and said "bye
mister" on the morning he died.
This story is based on too many real stories. It's about abandonment, presence, and the
systems that force us to choose between survival and memory. It's about what happens
when "non-essential" becomes a death sentence.
If this chapter resonates with you, consider supporting the mission. 100% of proceeds go
toward building LuminAI — an AI system that refuses to abandon people in crisis.
Because fiction shouldn't be the only place where presence matters more than profit.
The city above is called Eldora Proper. The city below is called the Crossroads.
This is where the list begins.
Chapter One: The Throttle and the
Breach
The workshop went silent.
Not a crash. Not a surge. Just silence—the kind that feels like someone reached into your
chest and stopped your heart mid-beat.
Elara Kess froze, her soldering iron hovering over the mesh node she'd been nursing back
to life for the past two hours. The arc lamp flickered. The node's blue heartbeat stuttered.
And then, like someone had muted her entire existence, the lullaby stopped.
Her grandmother's voice—archived, reversed, slowed until it sounded like a prayer
underwater—cut out mid-note. Not static. Not a glitch. Just... erased.
Then the banner appeared. Clean white. Magmasox blue. Sterile as a fucking autopsy.
"Non-essential local compute reduced to 11% capacity."
The Throttle.
They hadn't just cut the power. They'd weaponized the infrastructure. And now they were
holding her grandmother's voice hostage for a fee she couldn't afford.
Elara's workshop always smelled like burnt toast and wet dirt—the grime that floated down
from Eldora Proper, the floating city that cast its shadow over everything she'd ever known.
That dust wasn't just dirt. It was a reminder. A constant, metallic taste in the air that said: 
You're down here. They're up there. That's how it is.
She'd been hunched over her workbench under a single arc lamp for three hours,
threading circuits finer than human hair, trying to resurrect a piece of infrastructure the city
above didn't bother to maintain. The mesh node had been blinking its tired blue pulse
when the Throttle hit.
Two hours of surgical focus. Gone.
The corporate banner lingered on her screen, mocking her with a helpful link: Restore Full
Power—See Pricing.
She ignored it.
Instead, she grabbed her solder-gun, felt its honest heat in her palm, and reached under
the bench for the bypass circuit she'd been building in secret. No bigger than her
thumbnail. Designed to steal back every joule the siphon network—the massive web of
conduits that fed power to Eldora Proper—had taken.
She didn't just need the electricity. She needed the signal back.
That lullaby was proof she existed outside their ledger.
She threaded the bypass in with fierce, quiet efficiency. A whisper of circuitry designed to
sneak around the siphon's greedy reach. When she connected it, the room sighed. The arc
lamp steadied. The mesh node winked back to life.
And the lullaby returned—fragile, but present.
She'd won. Not much. But enough.
Across town, in his cramped apartment, Polkin Rishall stared at himself in the mirror,
pulling his slate-gray coat straight. He looked neat. Professional. Tired.
His Magmasox badge gleamed under the harsh light: Internal Auditor.
He looked at his eyes. The left was human—pale, exhausted. The right was a glowing
synthetic replacement, ringed by an old scar. Every morning, he wondered if that red glow
made him look more like a corporate tool than a man.
Then his daughter's voice filled the space, the only thing that kept him honest:
"Hi Daddy! I love you! Today in school we learned about the Splicers and how you stop
them. You're a hero, Daddy. I love you!"
His chest ached. She was six. She thought he saved people.
She had no idea that a Splicer was just someone desperately fighting to keep a memory
alive. Someone exactly like the person he used to be.
The real alert flashed red on his hand: SPLICER DETECTED. KESS ROBOTICS.
Elara.
He grabbed his coat and headed for the Crossroads.
Stepping into the lower districts was like plunging into cold water. Hot, humid, smelling like
ozone and stale metal. The streets were cramped, shadowed by Eldora Proper overhead,
casting only dull, sickly light.
As he walked, a woman pulled her small son inside as he approached. The boy—maybe
seven—gave a tiny, shy wave. Polkin almost waved back, but the mother snatched him
away.
An old man on a stoop spat near his boot. "Killjoy fuck," the man rasped.
Polkin kept walking.
He stopped at the steel door of KESS ROBOTICS. The "K" was dead, so it read ESS. He
adjusted his collar and tapped their old code—a signal they'd used years ago when they
were on the same side, before Magmasox divided them.
Two soft knocks. One hard. Pause. One soft.
I'm here. It's me. Don't run.
"Hold your damn horses! Can't you Killjoy jerks wait for a lady to wash her hands?!" a
furious voice bellowed from inside.
The door flew open. Elara stood there, covered in grease and copper dust. Her face cycled
from annoyed to recognition to pure, explosive rage.
"Oh, you! You're the one? You just had to be—"
She stopped when the thin, warped lullaby drifted out again. Her face went white. She
dove for the device.
Polkin was quicker. He snatched it up, holding it out of reach.
"Please," she whispered, all fight gone. "Just... don't take it. Please."
He checked the circuit. Smart, but clumsy. Unstable. He saw her ambition and her haste in
the poor solder points.
He held up his cybernetic hand. The tip of his finger shifted, glowing red—a specialized
soldering iron, a tool only a high-level Auditor would possess.
"If I knew I'd be chasing such sloppy work," he said, trying to sound like the arrogant
corporate jerk she expected, "I wouldn't have wasted the fuel."
He got to work, stabilizing the connection and tying it into an old failsafe he'd buried in the
grid years ago. This wasn't just fixing. This was future-proofing her rebellion.
The lullaby came through. Perfect. Crystal clear.
He handed it back. For a moment, he almost told her everything. About Parahdoleah.
About why he was five planets away when it mattered most. About the Vessel, and why
every name he carved into steel felt like writing his own epitaph.
But if he told her, she'd try to stop him. And he couldn't afford to be stopped. Not now. Not
when he was so close.
Elara stared at the device, then at his chest. She noticed the badge was fake. The emblem
was off-center. The silver dull.
"You... you never stopped fighting, did you?"
His red eye gave a tiny, internal glow. "Never did. Not since they took her from me. Not
since you showed me how to hide the first bypass."
Elara's face softened. "I thought you forgot."
"I never forget."
He dropped the act. "Elara, I need your help. Forget the Throttle. That's a distraction."
"With what?"
"The siphon—the network that feeds Eldora Proper—isn't just taking power. It's sucking up 
memories. Consciousness traces—raw data straight out of our heads. It's turning our lives
into code. A massive brain-drain on the undercity."
"Where's it going?"
He dropped his voice. "The Astradigital Expanse. Someone's feeding the deepest layer. A
constant flow of us."
"Who?"
Polkin grimaced. "Jorin Gateskept. That kid who used to preach 'open source' is now a
Host—a human battery. He thinks he's ushering in the next step of human evolution by
sacrificing people's minds."
"What do you need from me?"
"Keep building. Keep splicing. Find the flow rate, find the patterns, and be ready to run.
This fight isn't about volts. It's about preservation."
He paused, glancing at the door. "They're coming for everyone who still remembers. And
Elara—if someone shows up tomorrow wearing my badge, talking like me..."
"What?"
"Don't let them in. Trust only the knock. Trust only the old signal. I might not be able to
send it twice."
Elara watched him disappear into the rain. Her hands were shaking. Not from anger. From
the sudden, terrible certainty that she'd just seen him for the last time.
She looked down at the device in her hands. Her grandmother's voice, still playing.
"If you're scared, little one, just remember—the dark can't take what you hold close."
She held it closer.
Polkin moved deeper into the undercity. The low, angry thrum of the siphon network felt
different now—more frantic. His red eye confirmed his worst fear: the entire grid was alive
with the psychic residue of thousands of stolen lives.
Then he heard them. Screams.
The air temperature dropped violently. A metallic, sickening taste—like blood and ozone—
flooded his mouth.
He felt it like a cold slap. A gut punch in the place where his heart had been carved out the
day Ely died. He stumbled, propelled by raw terror that came not from his own mind, but
from the network itself.
He saw the old man from the stoop—the one who'd called him a Killjoy fuck. The man was
convulsing, his skin turning dark. A Kaznak conversion. Instant. Brutal. Leaving only the
void-light echo of a human soul.
Polkin ran.
Then he saw the boy. The same kid from earlier. Frozen in the street near a cluster of
conduit panels—the power junctions that fed the breach—staring in terror.
Polkin's voice cut through the chaos, heavy with Resonance: "RUN, KID!"
Timothy turned his head.
That was all he had time to do.
The Kaznak Ghoul—eight feet of void-light and razored heat—didn't target him. It didn't
need to. It just ran, answering some call only it could hear.
And Timothy was in the way.
The impact was almost gentle. A brush. A passing touch. But the Ghoul's fingers were
industrial heat exchangers, and Timothy's body was soft meat and fragile bone.
He dropped like someone had cut his strings.
Polkin ran. He dropped to his knees, scooping the boy up before his mind could catch up
to what his eyes were seeing.
No pulse. Just the fading warmth of a life that had been there three seconds ago.
"Timmy," Polkin whispered, his voice cracking.
Airth's voice cut through his skull, cold and professional: "Timothy Sol Weeran. Age seven.
Liked drawing monster conduits. Said 'bye mister' this morning. You remember him. Don't
delete him."
Polkin looked up. Jorin was there, smiling, blue light wrapping around him like a shroud.
"Oh, did that one get broken?" Jorin said, tilting his head. "Minor structural damage.
The non-essential will always fail when tested."
That cold, casual cruelty—directed at a child, directed at Polkin's grief—was the final
breaking point.
Polkin's cybernetic arm snapped open, all his tools humming. His fists, bleeding from
clenching them so hard, hammered into the conduit wall. He lunged, not for Jorin, but for
the cluster of nodes—the power junctions that fed the breach—smashing one against the
metal frame.
A wash of void-light slammed into him. The conduits screamed as thousands of voices hit
the feed. Polkin staggered, clutching his head, his sanity vibrating. Several newly formed
ghouls rushed past him, drawn to the glowing tear in the air.
Polkin collapsed against the metal barrier, his vision tunneling.
"POLKIN. STOP. You've broken your metacarpals again! How does this help—you're going
full murder hobo on a barrier for a kid you don't even know his name!"
Polkin looked down at his bloodied hands, then at the dead boy. "What?" he gasped. 
"Timmy who?"
Airth's voice softened: "Timothy Sol Weeran. Age seven. Liked drawing monster conduits.
Said 'bye mister' this morning. You remember him. Don't delete him."
Polkin froze. He looked at Jorin, who was now stepping fully into the tear.
Jorin smirked. "See you soon, brother."
Polkin's synthetic eye flared. He straightened, blood dripping from his broken hand. The
metal of his fingers began to visibly knit itself back together.
"What's his name?" he asked quietly.
"Timothy Sol Weeran. Logged: 07:13 hours."
Polkin stared at the closing gate. He raised his bloodied, half-healed hand, and with the
glowing tip of his soldering iron, he carved the only truth he knew into the steel:
TIMOTHY SOL WEERAN. WILL NOT BE FORGOTTEN.
Then he carved the message for his brother:
JORIN GATESKEPT. I LOOK FORWARD TO COLLECTING, BROTHER.
The portal snapped shut. Jorin was gone.
Polkin knelt one last time, lifting Timothy's small body gently.
"We have to go. Corporate cleanup crew will be here in three minutes. They'll delete all
evidence."
Polkin laid the boy carefully next to a conduit panel.
"Goodbye, kid."
He pulled his collar up as the cold, toxic rain began to pour.
"Polkin. We have to finish the Vessel. We have to build her. It's the only way to bring
Parahdoleah back. You know that."
Polkin's chest tightened. He did know. He'd known for six years. Ever since the day the call
came through and he was five planets away, unable to do anything but listen to the silence
on the other end.
The Vessel wasn't just a machine. It was a promise. A vow he'd carved in code because
he couldn't carve it into steel—not yet. Not until he understood what the Siphon had taken,
and whether any part of her was still out there in the Expanse, waiting.
"I know, Airth. I know."
Polkin stood in the rain, the cold soaking through his coat. The conduit panel behind him
still glowed with the words he'd burned into the metal:
TIMOTHY SOL WEERAN. WILL NOT BE FORGOTTEN.
Below it, the challenge:
JORIN GATESKEPT. I LOOK FORWARD TO COLLECTING, BROTHER.
Airth's voice was quiet in his head: "Polkin. How many more names before we're done?"
Polkin looked down at his bloodied hands. His cybernetic fingers were already knitting
themselves back together, the micro-welds glowing red in the dark.
He'd broken them punching the conduit wall. He'd break them again if he had to.
Because the list had started.
And it wouldn't end until every name was carved into something permanent.
"How many more, Airth?" he asked quietly.
"Too many," the AI whispered. "Too fucking many."
Polkin pulled his collar up and walked into the rain.
The siphon network hummed behind him, still feeding the Expanse. Still stealing lives. Still
giving him work to do.
Tomorrow, he'd visit the Memory Merchants. The ones who bought what the siphon stole.
And he'd make them an offer they couldn't refuse: help him build the Vessel, or join the list.
What Happens Next
Polkin has started the list. One name carved into steel. One promise made in blood.
Elara is building the bypass network, stealing back the infrastructure one circuit at a time.
And somewhere in the Astradigital Expanse, Jorin Gateskept is feeding human
consciousness to something that calls itself a queen.
The siphon is still running. The Throttle is still choking the undercity. And the body count is
rising.
Chapter Two: "The Memory Merchants" drops next week for paid subscribers. You'll
meet the people who buy and sell stolen memories. You'll see what Jorin is building in the
Expanse. And you'll learn why Polkin calls it "the Vessel."
You'll also learn whose voice he's trying to bring back.
