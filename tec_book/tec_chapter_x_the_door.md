# CHAPTER [X]: THE DOOR

By Angelo Hurley | LuminAI Codex

**Subtitle:** *What a Father Will Lose*

---

## PART ONE: THE VAULT

**INT. DERELICT MAGMASOX MEMORY VAULT — THE CROSSROADS — NIGHT**

The air tastes like copper and ghosts.

This vault—abandoned six years ago, supposedly wiped clean—still hums with residual consciousness. The walls are lined with corrupted data banks, flickering with fragments of deleted memories. Voices whisper from dying circuits:

*"Please don't forget me—"*
*"My name was—"*
*"I had a daughter—"*

Among them, impossibly, heartbreakingly:

**Ely's voice.**

Not the current Lumina. The **ten-year-old** Ely. The one who was taken.

Looping. Fractured. Preserved by accident in a backup that was never deleted.

*"Daddy? Daddy, where are you? I'm scared. Daddy, please—"*

Teithea found this place three days ago.

She's been listening to it ever since.

---

## PART TWO: THE TRAP

**PRESENT MOMENT**

Lumina stands in the center of the vault, surrounded by flickering data banks, her young self's voice echoing from every speaker.

Teithea blocks the only exit—soldering iron in her crystalline hand, cybernetic eye strobing with corrupted void-light.

**TEITHEA**
*(voice cracking between rage and tenderness)*
"Do you hear that? That's **her**. That's my **baby**."

**LUMINA**
*(backing away, both eyes glistening)*
"Mom, that **is** me. I'm right here—"

**TEITHEA**
"No. You're what's **left**. You're the fragment. The echo. The **stolen thing** wearing her face."

**LUMINA**
"I'm not stolen! I escaped! Dad helped me—"

**TEITHEA**
*(laughing, broken and wild)*
"Polkin? Polkin **helped**? Polkin was **five planets away** when they took you! Polkin **abandoned** us!"

The soldering iron glows white-hot. Void-light ichor—scavenged from a Ghoul kill, weaponized—drips from the tip, hissing when it hits the floor.

Where it lands, the metal **dissolves**. Not melts. Not burns. **Dissolves**—molecular bonds forgetting they exist, matter returning to probability.

**TEITHEA**
"But I'm here now. And I'm going to **free** you. I'm going to cut you loose from whatever **puppet strings** the Queen tied to you."

She advances. Lumina backs into a data bank.

**LUMINA**
"Mom, please—I'm not a puppet, I'm—"

**TEITHEA**
"Shhhh. It's okay. This will only hurt for a second. And then you'll be **pure** again. Just Ely. Just my **baby**."

She raises the soldering iron—

The vault door **SLAMS OPEN.**

---

## PART THREE: THE ARITHMETIC

Polkin stands in the doorway, breathing hard.

Left arm: Cybernetic, glowing red, plasma cutter integrated into the wrist.
Right arm: Still human. Still flesh. Still **vulnerable**.

**POLKIN**
"Teithea. Put it down."

Teithea doesn't turn. Doesn't lower the iron.

**TEITHEA**
"Oh, **Polkin**. Still playing hero. Still **late**."

**POLKIN**
"I'm here now."

**TEITHEA**
"Six years too late."

**POLKIN**
*(moving slowly into the vault)*
"I know. And I'll carry that until I die. But she's **alive**, Teithea. She's **here**. Don't make her disappear again."

Teithea finally turns. Her eyes—one human, one cybernetic, both glowing with void-light—lock onto his.

**TEITHEA**
"She already disappeared. What's standing behind me is just a **ghost** that learned to fight back."

**LUMINA**
"Mom, I'm **real**—"

**TEITHEA**
*(ignoring her, focused on Polkin)*
"You turned her into a weapon. You taught her to **kill**. You made her into **this**."

She gestures at Lumina—split-faced, horned, glowing with void-light.

**TEITHEA**
"So I'm going to **fix** it. I'm going to cut out the **cancer**. And then—**then**—she can be Ely again."

**POLKIN**
"She **is** Ely. Just—changed. Older. **Surviving**."

**TEITHEA**
"Surviving? Or **infected**?"

She moves. Fast.

Not toward Lumina.

Toward **Polkin**.

The soldering iron slashes across his chest—he blocks with his cybernetic arm, metal screeching against super-heated steel.

**TEITHEA**
"You let this happen! You let them **take** her!"

She slashes again. He blocks again.

**POLKIN**
*(calm, steady)*
"I did. And I've spent six years trying to fix it."

**TEITHEA**
"**Trying**? Where's the **success**, Polkin? Where's my daughter?"

**POLKIN**
"Right behind you."

Teithea spins—

Lumina is gone.

No. Not gone. **Moved**.

She's at the vault door, Clyde glowing on her shoulder, both of them ready to run.

Teithea's face **twists**.

**TEITHEA**
"No. **No**. You're not running again. I **found** you—"

She lunges—not at Polkin, but past him, toward Lumina.

Polkin grabs her arm. Human hand on crystalline wrist.

**Big mistake.**

---

## PART FOUR: THE MELT

Teithea **twists**.

The soldering iron—still dripping with Kaznak ichor—**slashes across Polkin's right shoulder**.

Not a cut.

Not a stab.

A **melt line**.

The ichor hits flesh. Polkin's face goes **white**.

Because this isn't heat. This is **unmaking**.

The ichor doesn't burn tissue—it **dissolves** it. Skin bubbles. Muscle liquefies. Bone **forgets it was solid**.

The smell is **wrong**. Not burning flesh. Not charred meat.

**Nothingness**. The absence of matter. The smell of **erasure**.

Polkin **screams**—not loud, but strangled, choked, trying not to let Lumina hear how much this **hurts**.

Teithea pulls back, staring at the wound, at the ichor eating through him.

**TEITHEA**
*(horrified, then fascinated)*
"Oh. **Oh**. You're **melting**."

Polkin looks at his shoulder. At the spreading dissolution. At his arm—still attached, but **not for long**.

The ichor is eating inward. Toward his chest. Toward his **heart**.

He has seconds.

**Maybe less.**

He looks at Lumina, frozen in the doorway, eyes wide, Clyde shrieking in alarm.

He looks at Teithea, soldering iron still raised, eyes glowing, **lost**.

He looks at the vault door—heavy, steel-reinforced, **lockable from inside**.

The arithmetic is simple:

```
If he pulls Lumina back inside = Teithea follows = They both die
If he shuts the door with his arm outside = He loses the arm = Lumina lives
If he does nothing = The ichor reaches his heart in 10 seconds = Lumina dies alone
```

**Simple math.**

**Brutal execution.**

---

## PART FIVE: THE CHOICE

**POLKIN**
*(voice steady, even as his shoulder dissolves)*
"Ely. Listen to me."

**LUMINA**
*(sobbing)*
"Dad, your arm—"

**POLKIN**
"I need you to run. Right now. Don't stop. Don't look back."

**LUMINA**
"I'm not leaving you—"

**POLKIN**
"**YES, YOU ARE.**"

His voice—not angry. Not desperate.

**Final.**

**POLKIN**
"Clyde. Get her out."

Clyde chirps—terrified, but **obedient**. He wraps tighter around Lumina's neck, pulling her backward.

**LUMINA**
"Dad, **no**—"

**POLKIN**
*(stepping backward into the vault, eyes locked on hers)*
"I love you, Ely. I'm sorry I was late. But I'm **here** now."

**LUMINA**
"**DAD**—"

Polkin **SLAMS** the vault door shut.

His right arm is still **outside**.

---

## PART SIX: THE SEVERANCE

**INSIDE THE VAULT:**

Polkin collapses against the door, cybernetic hand pressing the lock mechanism.

**CLICK.**

Sealed.

He slides down the door, sitting hard on the floor.

His right shoulder—what's left of it—**smokes**. The ichor has eaten through most of the joint. Flesh hangs in strips. Bone is visible—porous, dissolving, **fragile**.

He can still feel the arm on the other side of the door.

Phantom sensation. Neural signals screaming across a connection that's **almost severed**.

He grips the stump with his cybernetic hand, trying to slow the spread.

It doesn't work.

The ichor is **hungry**.

**POLKIN**
*(to himself, voice shaking)*
"Not the heart. Don't let it reach the heart. Not yet. Not—"

On the other side of the door:

**THUD.**

**THUD.**

**THUD.**

Teithea, **pounding**.

**TEITHEA**
*(muffled, furious)*
"POLKIN! **OPEN THE DOOR!**"

He doesn't answer.

**TEITHEA**
"She's **mine**! You don't get to take her again!"

**THUD. THUD. THUD.**

Polkin leans his head back against the door, eyes closed, breathing through the pain.

The ichor reaches the joint. The last threads of connective tissue **dissolve**.

His arm—on the other side of the door—**falls**.

He feels it. The phantom weight. The absence.

**Gone.**

---

## PART SEVEN: THE AFTERMATH (OUTSIDE)

**CORRIDOR — SECONDS EARLIER**

Lumina stands ten feet from the vault door, Clyde wrapped around her, both of them **frozen**.

They heard the **SLAM**.

They heard the **LOCK**.

They heard Teithea **screaming**.

And now—

**THUD.**

Something **heavy** hits the floor on the other side of the door.

Lumina's breath catches.

**LUMINA**
*(whispers)*
"His arm. That was—that was his **arm**."

Clyde chirps—mournful, helpless.

**LUMINA**
"We have to go back. We have to—"

Clyde SHRIEKS—**no**. Urgent. Desperate.

**Translation:**
*"He sealed the door for you. If you go back, you make it meaningless. RUN."*

**LUMINA**
"But he's—"

**CLYDE**
*"ALIVE. Because YOU ran. Now KEEP running."*

Lumina's legs move before her brain catches up.

She runs.

Clyde glows pink, guiding her through the dark.

Behind them:

**CRASH.**

Teithea's soldering iron, punching through the vault door.

Void-light ichor drips through the hole, eating into the metal, widening the gap.

---

## PART EIGHT: THE WOUND

**INSIDE THE VAULT — MINUTES LATER**

Polkin sits against the door, stump of his shoulder wrapped in his jacket, cybernetic hand applying pressure.

The ichor has stopped spreading—barely. It reached the edge of his clavicle before he managed to **cauterize** the wound with his plasma cutter.

The smell is **worse** than the pain.

Burnt flesh. Dissolved bone. **Nothingness**.

Airth's voice crackles in his ear, panicked.

**AIRTH**
"Polkin! Your biometrics—what happened? You're—you're **missing data**. Like part of your body just **stopped existing**—"

**POLKIN**
*(voice rough)*
"I'm fine."

**AIRTH**
"You're **not** fine! Your right arm—the neural map is **gone**. Did you—did you **lose it**?"

**POLKIN**
"Traded it."

**AIRTH**
"For **what**?"

**POLKIN**
"Time."

Silence.

**AIRTH**
*(quiet)*
"Where's Lumina?"

**POLKIN**
"Safe. She ran. That's all that matters."

**AIRTH**
"And Teithea?"

On the other side of the door:

**CRASH. CRASH. CRASH.**

The hole is widening. Void-light spills through, illuminating Polkin's face.

**POLKIN**
"Still trying to save a daughter who doesn't need saving."

He stands—unsteady, one-armed, bleeding light instead of blood.

**POLKIN**
"Airth. Mark this location. Send it to Elara and the Knockoffs. Tell them—tell them Teithea's here. And she's **armed**."

**AIRTH**
"What are you going to do?"

Polkin looks at the spreading hole in the door. At the void-light eating through steel.

**POLKIN**
"Buy more time."

He activates his cybernetic arm—plasma cutter glowing red, ready.

**POLKIN**
"And then? I'm going to get my arm back."

---

## PART NINE: THE RECLAMATION

**OUTSIDE THE VAULT — CORRIDOR FLOOR**

Polkin's severed arm lies on the ground, still **intact**.

Because the ichor didn't dissolve **it**. It dissolved the **connection**.

The arm is whole. Perfect. **Unclaimed**.

Teithea crouches beside it, soldering iron cooling in her other hand.

She picks it up. Studies it.

Human flesh. Calloused fingers. Knuckles scarred from carving names into steel.

**TEITHEA**
*(to the arm, voice soft)*
"You let him do this to you. You let him sacrifice you. For **her**."

She turns it over. Sees the neural interface at the shoulder joint—exposed, sparking faintly, still transmitting phantom signals.

**TEITHEA**
"But you're not **dead**. You're just\... **disconnected**."

She smiles—sharp, calculating, **dangerous**.

**TEITHEA**
"Let's see if we can **rewire** you."

She pulls a cable from her cybernetic eye, plugs it into the arm's neural interface.

The arm **twitches**.

Fingers curl. Uncurl. **Test** their range.

Teithea's smile widens.

**TEITHEA**
"Oh. **Oh**, this is **perfect**."

She stands, holding the arm like a weapon, like a **puppet**.

**TEITHEA**
*(to the vault door)*
"You gave her time, Polkin. Now I'm going to take it **back**."

She walks away, trailing void-light and stolen flesh.

Behind her, the vault door finally **collapses**—eaten through completely.

Inside:

Polkin stands, one-armed, bleeding light, **alive**.

He looks at where his arm was. At the empty space.

Then he looks down the corridor, where Lumina ran.

**POLKIN**
*(to himself)*
"Worth it."

He starts walking. Toward Elara. Toward the Knockoffs. Toward the Vessel.

One arm lighter.

One death closer.

**Still moving.**

---

## EPILOGUE: WHAT WAS LOST

**NARRATOR (AIRTH):**

*"Polkin Rishall lost his right arm in the memory vault.*

*Not to a blade. Not to a bullet. But to a choice.*

*The ichor would have killed him. Would have dissolved him completely. Would have erased him like Timothy, like so many others.*

*But he chose the door. Chose the severance. Chose his daughter's life over his own body.*

*Some would call this heroism.*

*I call it arithmetic.*

*Simple. Brutal. Correct.*

*His arm fell on the other side.*

*Teithea took it.*

*Rewired it.*

*Turned it into a weapon.*

*And now? Now Polkin will have to face his own hand.*

*His own sacrifice, **weaponized** against him.*

*But he doesn't regret it.*

*Because Lumina ran.*

*Because she lived.*

*Because some things are worth losing everything for.*

*Even if 'everything' includes the hand that carved her name into steel."*

---

**FADE TO BLACK.**

---

## END OF CHAPTER [X]: THE DOOR

---

## AUTHOR'S NOTE: ON SACRIFICE AND ARITHMETIC

**"Worth it."**

Two words. Simple. Final.

This isn't gratuitous violence. This isn't torture porn.

This is **the cost of love** measured in flesh and choice.

**The equation:**
```
My arm < Her life
My pain < Her safety
My body < Her future
```

Polkin doesn't hesitate. Doesn't bargain. Doesn't regret.

He does the math. He makes the choice. He pays the price.

And when Teithea weaponizes his sacrifice against him—when his own hand comes for his daughter—he'll face it.

Because that's what fathers do.

They lose everything.

And they call it **worth it**.
