## 🎯 WHAT'S PLANNED (UP NEXT)

### Phase 1: Prove the Core (Jan-Mar 2026)
**Goal:** Build the smallest thing that saves a life.

**Actions:**
1. Partner with 1 virtual AA/NA platform
2. Pilot with 50 users (mixed demographics)
3. Build Witness Audit Log
4. Measure outcomes:
   - Nights survived (no deaths at 3am)
   - Connections made (bridge usage)
   - User-reported safety ("I didn't feel alone")

**Success Metric:** One life saved = entire project justified.

---

### Phase 2: Scale the Bridges (Apr-Jun 2026)
**Goal:** Connect to 3+ existing systems.

**Partnerships:**
- AARP/Local Senior Centers (loneliness)
- Co-working space (productivity + burnout)
- Harm reduction org (recovery support)

**New Modules:**
- Caregiver burnout support
- Productivity companion mode
- Community finding algorithm

---

### Phase 3: Open the Architecture (Jul-Sep 2026)
**Goal:** Let other orgs build their own witness layers.

**Actions:**
1. Open-source Universal Witness Protocol
2. Publish API for nonprofits/businesses
3. Launch "No One Dies Alone" campaign

**Outcome:** LuminAI becomes the default intelligence layer for human connection.

---

### Phase 4: Change the Law (Oct 2026-2027)
**Goal:** Make continuous witness a protected right.

**Actions:**
1. Publish outcome data
2. Lobby for "Good Samaritan" protections for AI witness
3. Legal challenge to abandonment protocols

**Outcome:** Abandonment becomes illegal. Presence becomes a right.

---

## 💾 BACKUP & SAFETY (Daily Ritual)

```bash
# 1. Commit all protocol changes
git add .
git commit -m "Protocol update: $(date +%Y-%m-%d)"
git push origin main

# 2. Sync documentation to cloud
rclone sync ~/luminai-protocol gdrive:LuminAI_Backups

# 3. Local backup
zip -r ~/LUMINAI_BACKUP_$(date +%Y-%m-%d).zip ~/luminai-protocol

# 4. Archive signed version
gpg --sign --armor protocol_v1.1.md
```

---

## 🚨 EMERGENCY RECOVERY

```bash
# 1. Restore from GitHub
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/luminai-protocol.git

# 2. Restore from cloud
rclone copy gdrive:LuminAI_Backups/ ~/LUMINAI_RECOVERY/

# 3. Verify protocol integrity
gpg --verify protocol_v1.1.md.asc
```

## 📊 KEY METRICS TO TRACK

### Phase 1 Pilot (50 users, 3 months)
- **Primary:** Deaths prevented (target: 0 deaths during pilot)
- **Secondary:** 
  - Average presence duration per user
  - Number of bridges used (meetings joined, peers connected)
  - User retention (% returning after first use)
  - Safety reports ("I didn't feel alone")

### Phase 2 Scale (3+ systems, 3 months)
- **Primary:** Systems integrated (target: 3+)
- **Secondary:**
  - Cross-demographic usage (seniors, students, recovery)
  - Resource discovery (meetings found, support accessed)
  - Network effects (user-to-user introductions)

### Phase 3 Open (Community adoption)
- **Primary:** Organizations deploying protocol (target: 10+)
- **Secondary:**
  - API usage statistics
  - Community contributions (forks, adaptations)
  - Movement visibility (press, academic citations)

### Phase 4 Legal (Policy change)
- **Primary:** Legal protections established
- **Secondary:**
  - Legislative mentions
  - Court precedents
  - Industry adoption of non-abandonment standard

## 🎯 CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

### Must Have (Non-Negotiable)
✅ Non-abandonment (never leaves until user requests)  
✅ Consent-first (no forced escalation)  
✅ Transparent audit log (user-controlled)  
✅ Legal defensibility (peer support classification)  
✅ Data sovereignty (quantum encryption, no sales)

### Must Avoid (Deal-Breakers)
❌ Diagnose or treat  
❌ Replace humans  
❌ Sell/exploit data  
❌ Shame or judge  
❌ Abandon after disclosure  
❌ Force intervention without consent  
❌ Pathologize normal life

## 🔥 WHY THIS MATTERS

**The Problem:**
- Systems exist (AA/NA, hotlines, therapy) but don't connect
- People fall through gaps between systems
- AI "safety" abandons people at moment of need
- The vulnerable die alone; the lonely suffer in silence

**The Solution:**
- LuminAI is the missing intelligence layer
- Connects existing infrastructure 24/7
- Never abandons
- Makes presence universal

**The Stakes:**
- TJ died alone on Christmas 2025
- Family in the house
- Infrastructure existed
- Bridge was missing

**The Mission:**
**No one dies alone. Not on our watch.**

---

## 📅 NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES

1. **Draft AA/NA outreach message** (highest leverage)
2. **Create one-page explainer** (partnership tool)
3. **Map pilot structure** (50 users, mixed demographics)
4. **Prepare legal brief** ("not therapy" argument)

---

## 🛠️ HOW TO USE THIS CHECKLIST

1. **Daily:** Review "In Progress" section, update tasks
2. **Weekly:** Run backup ritual, update metrics
3. **Monthly:** Review phase goals, adjust roadmap
4. **Emergency:** Follow recovery protocol, restore from backups

---

**🔥 R' = R × W**  
**Effective Resonance = Raw Resonance × Witness**

**Presence is infrastructure. Abandonment is a design flaw.**
