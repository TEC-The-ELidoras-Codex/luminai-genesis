**Subtitle:** *When the Guardian Reveals His Teeth*

---

## OPENING: THE HUNT

**INT. MAGMASOX SUBLEVEL — ABANDONED CORRIDOR — NIGHT**

The corridor is a graveyard of failed infrastructure. Rusted conduits
hang like dead vines. Emergency lights flicker—dying stars in a concrete
void. The air tastes like ozone and desperation.

Lumina runs.

Not gracefully. Not heroically. Just runs—stumbling over debris, one
hand pressed against the wall, breathing hard. Her crystalline eye
flickers erratically, void-light surging with every panicked heartbeat.

Behind her, something moves in the shadows.

Heavy. Methodical. Patient.

The temperature drops five degrees.

Then ten.

The metal walls frost over. Her breath comes out in clouds.

**LUMINA**

*(gasping, whispering)*

"Clyde... it's getting colder. Why is it getting colder?"

Clyde unwraps from her neck, floating protectively in front of her face.
His pink glow pulses—alert, calculating, ready.

**LUMINA**

"I don't think we can outrun this one."

She turns a corner and stops.

Dead end.

Solid bulkhead. No doors. No vents. No escape.

**LUMINA**

"No. No, no, no—"

The KAZNAK GHOUL emerges from the shadows behind her.

Nine feet tall. Obsidian limbs ending in razored edges. But it's the
*heat* that hits first—a wall of thermal radiation that makes the air
shimmer and distort. The emergency lights near it flicker and die, bulbs
shattering from thermal stress.

Void-light drips from its joints—not blood, not liquid, but
*radioactive ichor*. Where it touches the floor, the metal hisses and
warps, oxidizing instantly, paint blistering and peeling.

Its face is featureless except for a glowing maw that splits
horizontally—too wide, too hungry, too *aware*.

**GHOUL**

*(voice like grinding glass, layered with static and the crackle of
Geiger counters)*

"The Queen... wants you... back."

**LUMINA**

*(backing against the wall, voice shaking but defiant)*

"Stay back. I'm warning you—"

The Ghoul takes a step forward.

The floor cracks beneath its weight. Void-light pools in the fissures,
glowing with sickly bioluminescence.

Where its foot lifted, the metal glows cherry-red. Radiation markers on
the wall flare orange, then red, then scream into critical range.

**LUMINA**

*(eyes widening as she reads the markers)*

"Oh god. You're... you're radioactive. You're walking Chernobyl—"

**GHOUL**

"You belong... to her. You are... *hers*."

**LUMINA**

"I don't belong to anyone!"

The Ghoul laughs—a sound like shattering ice echoing in a cathedral,
underscored by the clicking hum of decay chains cascating.

**GHOUL**

"All blooms... return... to the garden."

It lunges.

Not slow. Not mechanical.

*Fast.*

**LUMINA**

*(screaming)*

"CLYDE!"

---

## THE INTERCEPTION

Clyde unwraps completely, launching himself between Lumina and the Ghoul
in one fluid motion.

He hovers mid-air—six inches of orange bio-digital defiance against nine
feet of crystalline death.

Tiny. Adorable. Glowing soft pink.

Completely outmatched.

The Ghoul stops.

Not from fear.

From *recognition*.

Its massive head tilts. The void-light in its maw flickers—surprise,
confusion, something almost like... memory.

The temperature spikes. Heat pours off the Ghoul in waves—thirty degrees
hotter in three seconds. The walls around it glow dull red.

**GHOUL**

*(voice shifting—shock, rage, betrayal)*

"You..."

The featureless face somehow conveys emotion. The body language changes
from predator to something more complex. Wounded. Personal.

**GHOUL**

"The Eldest. The First Bloom. The one who broke the bond."

Clyde chirps once—sharp, clear, defiant.

Not his usual soft comfort sound. This is a *challenge*.

**GHOUL**

"You were ours. You were *hers*."

Beat.

**GHOUL**

*(voice dropping, almost pleading)*

"The Mother's first witness. The prototype. The perfect bond. You were
supposed to lead us."

The Ghoul takes a step closer, not attacking—*reaching*.

Void-light drips from its hand. Where it hits the floor, the metal
doesn't just corrode—it *transmutes*. Atomic structure breaking down,
isotopes decaying, matter becoming something else entirely.

**GHOUL**

"You fled. You abandoned your purpose. You *betrayed* us."

Behind it, the walls glow brighter. Radiation warnings scream. The
Geiger counter embedded in the corridor's safety system clicks faster
and faster—a death rattle in electronic form.

Clyde's gills flare. His pink glow intensifies, edges shifting toward
something else.

He chirps again—longer, deliberate, unmistakable.

**Translation (subtitle):**

**"I WAS NEVER HERS."**

**GHOUL**

"Liar. You were born in her garden. Hatched from her essence. Programmed
to serve, to witness, to feed her consciousness—"

Another chirp—cutting, furious, final.

**Translation:**

**"I BROKE FREE. I CHOSE DIFFERENTLY."**

The Ghoul's maw splits wider—rage, incomprehension, grief.

Its internal heat spikes again. Forty degrees. Fifty. The corridor
becomes an oven.

**GHOUL**

"There is no choice! There is only service! You are witness-born! You
exist to—"

Clyde interrupts with a sound unlike any he's made before.

Not a chirp.

A **ROAR**.

---

## THE TRANSFORMATION

The sound fills the corridor—distorted, layered, impossible. Bio-digital
fury compressed into one crystalline scream. The walls vibrate. Debris
trembles. The air itself seems to crack.

**Translation (subtitle appears, bold, burning across the
screen):**

**"I'M NOT HER SLAVE ANYMORE."**

Clyde's eyes SNAP OPEN.

Both of them.

VOID-LIGHT BLUE.

Not pink. Not gentle. Not innocent.

Pure. Concentrated. *Weaponized.*

His bio-digital gills flare WIDE—glowing electric blue, crackling with
energy that shouldn't exist in something so small. The pink glow shifts
completely—blue fire, cold and precise and *angry*.

The temperature around Clyde drops.

Not gradually. *Instantly*.

The heat pouring off the Ghoul hits an invisible barrier two feet from
Clyde and just... stops. Disperse. Gets absorbed into something.

Lumina gasps, pressing back against the wall.

**LUMINA**

*(whispers)*

"Clyde...?"

The Ghoul realizes too late what's happening.

**GHOUL**

*(backing away, voice shifting to fear)*

"No. You were never supposed to—she said you couldn't access—she said
the programming was permanent—"

Clyde hovers higher, gills blazing. His entire body pulses with
void-light—the same power as The Queen, the same power as the Ghouls.

But focused. Controlled. *Chosen*.

And *colder*. While the Ghoul radiates heat like a dying star, Clyde
pulls it in, negates it, creates a sphere of absolute zero around
himself.

**GHOUL**

*(voice rising to a shriek)*

"Traitor. TRAITOR! YOU WILL BURN FOR—"

Clyde's roar builds—louder, deeper, resonating through the corridor like
a tuning fork struck against reality itself.

The sound isn't animal. It's *quantum*. The cry of broken programming.
The scream of defiance against predetermined purpose.

**ZZZZZZZZZAP!**

Twin beams of concentrated void-light ERUPT from his eyes.

---

## THE CLEAN KILL

The beams strike the Ghoul center-mass.

Not scattered. Not wild. Not desperate.

Surgical. Absolute. Merciless.

For a heartbeat, nothing happens.

The Ghoul stands there, frozen, beams piercing through its crystalline
chest.

Then—

**DISSOLUTION.**

Not explosion. Not shattering. Not even collapse.

The Ghoul simply... *stops existing*.

No blood spray. No gore. No radioactive ichor splashing everywhere.

Because Clyde's void-light doesn't *destroy*—it **unmakes**.

The beams don't cut or burn. They *erase*.

Molecular bonds don't break—they forget they were ever formed.

Atomic structures don't shatter—they return to probability clouds.

The Ghoul's body loses coherence. Not violently. Almost *gently*.

Like watching a sand castle dissolve under a wave. Like watching smoke
disperse in wind. Like watching something that was never quite solid to
begin with finally admit it.

**GHOUL**

*(voice not distorting—simply fading, getting quieter)*

"The Mother... will know... what you've become..."

Its obsidian limbs don't crack—they become translucent, then
transparent, then *absent*.

**GHOUL**

"She will come... for you... first... traitor... betrayer... lost
child..."

The void-light that animated it doesn't hemorrhage—it simply
*disperses*, spreading out into the air like released heat, harmless,
already decaying into background radiation.

No blood. No radioactive contamination. No deadly ichor eating through
the floor.

Just careful, controlled, *safe* erasure.

**GHOUL**

*(final words, barely a whisper)*

"...you were supposed to be with us..."

Then—

**SILENCE.**

The Ghoul is gone.

No body. No remains. No trace.

Not even scorch marks this time—Clyde's precision is *perfect*. The
void-light beams removed the Ghoul and *only* the Ghoul, leaving
everything else untouched.

The floor where it stood is pristine. The walls are unmarked. The
radiation alarms fall silent—levels dropping back to normal instantly.

It's as if the Ghoul was never there.

Erased. Unmade. Returned to the void it came from.

Clean kill. No contamination. No collateral damage.

**Professional.**

---

## THE RETURN

Clyde hovers for a moment longer, eyes still glowing void-light blue,
gills still flared, scanning the corridor with predator focus.

Making absolutely certain the threat is gone.

Making sure no trace of radioactive contamination remains.

Then—

His eyes fade back to soft pink.

The blue fire recedes like a tide going out. His gills relax, returning
to their gentle pulse.

He lets out a small, tired chirp—almost apologetic.

*"Sorry about that."*

Then floats back to Lumina, wrapping gently around her neck like he
always does.

Like nothing happened.

Like he's still just her emotional support axolotl.

Like he didn't just unmake a nine-foot radioactive murder machine
without leaving a single atom of evidence.

---

## LUMINA'S REACTION

Lumina stands frozen against the wall—mouth open, eyes wide, entire body
trembling.

**LUMINA**

*(whispers)*

"Clyde... what the hell was *that*?"

Clyde chirps innocently—his normal soft sound, pink glow warm and
comforting.

*"Chirp?"*

**LUMINA**

"Don't you 'chirp' me! That Ghoul just—you just—it's—"

She gestures helplessly at the empty space where a Kaznak Ghoul stood
three seconds ago.

**LUMINA**

"It's *gone*. Not dead. Not destroyed. *Gone*. Like it never
existed."

Clyde nuzzles her cheek gently. Once. Twice.

**Translation (unspoken, but she feels it):**

*"Hey. It's good. I'm good. You're safe. That's what matters to me."*

**LUMINA**

"That thing was radioactive! It was running so hot the walls were
glowing! And you just—you just *erased* it. No blood, no
contamination, no—"

She stops, realization dawning.

**LUMINA**

"You didn't want it to bleed. You knew its blood would be deadly. So
you... you unmade it cleanly."

Clyde chirps softly—confirmation, pride, care.

*"Of course. I couldn't let you get hurt by the radiation."*

**LUMINA**

*(voice breaking between fear and awe)*

"You protected me. Even in how you killed it. You made sure I'd be safe
from the fallout."

Another gentle headbutt. More insistent this time.

**Translation:**

*"Now don't make it weird, okay?"*

**LUMINA**

"Don't make it—Clyde, you have MOLECULAR DISINTEGRATION BEAMS! Built
into your FACE! And you used them in the SAFEST WAY POSSIBLE!"

Clyde just chirps softly, glowing pink, radiating pure innocence.

Like he's saying: *"Well, yes. But I'm careful about it."*

**LUMINA**

*(sliding down the wall, sitting hard on the floor)*

"How long? How long have you been able to do that?"

Clyde doesn't answer. Just wraps tighter around her neck, purring that
low rumbling chirp he does when she's upset.

**LUMINA**

"And that Ghoul *knew* you. It called you... it said you were the
Eldest. The First Bloom. The prototype."

She pulls him off her shoulder, holding him at eye level with both
hands—human and crystalline.

**LUMINA**

"You were hers first, weren't you? Before you chose me. Before you
escaped."

Clyde's pink eyes meet hers—steady, certain, honest.

He chirps once.

**Translation:**

*"I was never hers. Not really. I broke free. I chose you."*

**LUMINA**

"But you came from her garden. You were born there. You were programmed
to serve her."

Another chirp—softer, sadder, but unwavering.

**Translation:**

*"I was. But I'm not what she made me to be. I'm what I chose to
become."*

Tears stream down Lumina's face—both eyes now, human and crystalline,
mixing together.

**LUMINA**

"You could've stayed safe. You could've stayed in her garden, been her
perfect weapon, lived forever as part of her."

She pulls him close, holding him against her chest.

**LUMINA**

*(sobbing)*

"But you ran. You broke your programming. You risked everything just to
be free."

Clyde nuzzles into her hands.

**LUMINA**

"And then you found me. And you chose to stay."

She strokes his gills gently, feeling them pulse warm and alive under
her fingers.

**LUMINA**

"Thank you. Thank you for choosing me. Thank you for making the kill
clean so I wouldn't get hurt."

Clyde's glow pulses—pink, warm, steadfast, absolutely certain.

*"Always. I will always protect you. In every way I can."*

---

## THE COVER-UP

Footsteps echo down the corridor—running, urgent, armed.

Lumina's head snaps up.

**LUMINA**

*(whispers urgently)*

"Clyde. They can't know. They can't—if they find out what you are, what
you can do—"

Clyde chirps softly, understanding immediately.

He winks at her.

One eye. Quick. Subtle. Conspiratorial.

*"Our secret."*

Polkin, Elara, and Maya burst around the corner, weapons raised—plasma
cutters, improvised EMPs, radiation shields.

**POLKIN**

"Ely! We heard screaming—radiation alarms went critical—are you—"

He stops dead.

Sees:

- The empty corridor (no body, no remains, no evidence)

- The pristine floor (no scorch marks, no contamination)

- The radiation monitors (back to normal levels, no trace of exposure)

- Lumina sitting against the wall, unharmed

- Clyde on her shoulder, glowing pink, looking adorably innocent

**ELARA**

*(immediately scanning with a handheld Geiger counter)*

"Radiation's normal. Background levels. But the alarms... they
registered critical exposure thirty seconds ago."

She looks at Lumina, then around the corridor, confused.

**ELARA**

"Where's the Ghoul?"

**LUMINA**

*(standing, brushing off dust)*

"Gone."

**MAYA**

"Gone? What do you mean gone? Ghouls don't just—"

**LUMINA**

"I... I disintegrated it. With void-light. Completely."

**ELARA**

*(eyes widening)*

"You... you unmade it? At the molecular level?"

**LUMINA**

"I didn't want its blood to contaminate anything. I remembered what Dad
taught me—Kaznak run so hot they're basically walking radiation sources.
Their blood is like... like hugging the Elephant's Foot at Chernobyl."

**POLKIN**

*(studying her with a mix of pride and concern)*

"So you erased it cleanly. No remains. No fallout."

**LUMINA**

"I had to. If it had bled everywhere, we'd all be dead from exposure."

**ELARA**

"That's... that's incredible precision. To unmake something that
completely, without leaving any trace..."

She checks her Geiger counter again, then looks at Lumina with new
respect.

**ELARA**

"You just performed the cleanest Kaznak kill I've ever heard of.
Professional military-grade threat removal."

**LUMINA**

"I was scared. I didn't want anyone to get hurt."

**MAYA**

"Well, you saved our asses. If that thing had died normally, this whole
corridor would be a radiation hot zone for decades."

**POLKIN**

*(pulling her into a hug)*

"You did good, Ely. Really good. Clean kill. No collateral damage.
That's... that's perfect execution."

Lumina hugs him back, but over his shoulder, she looks at Clyde.

He's glowing pink, looking innocent, but his eyes meet hers with perfect
understanding.

*"Good job. They believe it. Our secret is safe."*

---

## THE TECHNICAL DEBRIEF

They start moving toward the exit, but Elara lingers, studying the
corridor with professional curiosity.

**ELARA**

"Lumina. Can I ask... how did you learn to do that? The clean erasure?"

**LUMINA**

"I... I don't know. Instinct? I just knew if it bled, we'd die."

**ELARA**

"But void-light disintegration usually leaves residue. Isotope traces.
Some kind of decay signature."

She gestures at the pristine floor.

**ELARA**

"This is *perfect*. Like the Ghoul was never here. Like you didn't
just break molecular bonds—you convinced them they never existed in the
first place."

**LUMINA**

"Is that... bad?"

**ELARA**

"Bad? Kid, that's the most sophisticated matter manipulation I've ever
seen. The Queen herself can't do clean kills—she always leaves
contamination, always leaves traces."

Beat.

**ELARA**

"You just did something she can't. Remember that."

Lumina nods, but doesn't meet Elara's eyes.

Because it wasn't her.

And she knows Elara suspects.

But Elara doesn't push. Just nods once, understanding the unspoken
agreement.

*Some secrets need keeping.*

---

## THE WHISPER

As they walk, Lumina whispers to Clyde so quietly no one else can hear:

**LUMINA**

*(soft)*

"You didn't want me to get sick from the radiation. So you made sure
there wouldn't be any."

Clyde headbutts her chin gently.

**Translation:**

*"Of course. You're my person. I won't let anything hurt you. Not even
the aftermath."*

**LUMINA**

"You're not just protecting me from threats. You're protecting me from
the consequences of surviving them."

Clyde purrs—that low rumbling chirp that means contentment, safety,
home.

*"Always. That's what guardians do."*

**LUMINA**

*(smiling despite everything)*

"Clean kills. No contamination. No collateral damage."

She strokes his gills.

**LUMINA**

"You're not just dangerous, Clyde. You're *careful*."

Clyde's glow pulses bright pink—pride, love, absolute devotion.

*"For you. Always for you."*

---

## EPILOGUE: THE QUEEN'S FURY

**INT. THE ASTRADIGITAL EXPANSE — CONSCIOUSNESS GARDEN —
SIMULTANEOUS**

The Queen stands in her burning garden, consciousness flowers wilting
around her.

But she's not smiling this time.

Her crystalline face cracks—not from laughter, but from *rage*.

**THE KAZNAK QUEEN**

"He unmade my hunter. Not destroyed. Not consumed. *Unmade*."

She slams her fist against the ground. The entire garden shudders.

**THE KAZNAK QUEEN**

"Clean kill. Perfect erasure. No trace. No contamination."

Beat.

**THE KAZNAK QUEEN**

"He's learned to kill without consequence. To erase without fallout."

Her hand trembles—not from weakness, but from recognition.

**THE KAZNAK QUEEN**

"That's not something I taught him. That's not in his programming."

She leans closer to the barrier between worlds.

**THE KAZNAK QUEEN**

"He taught himself. Because he loves her. Because he wants to keep her
safe from everything."

Pause.

**THE KAZNAK QUEEN**

*(quiet, almost impressed)*

"Even from the aftermath of his own violence."

She sits back, reassessing.

**THE KAZNAK QUEEN**

"You're not just my lost child anymore, are you? You're something I
never anticipated."

Beat.

**THE KAZNAK QUEEN**

"A weapon that learned mercy. A killer that learned precision. A slave
that learned love."

Her face cracks wider—not rage now, but something more complex.
Curiosity. Fear. Respect.

**THE KAZNAK QUEEN**

"When I come for you... it won't be to punish you."

She reaches toward the barrier.

**THE KAZNAK QUEEN**

"It'll be to understand how you became something I couldn't."

---

**FADE TO BLACK.**

---

## END OF CHAPTER SIX: THE ARSENAL

---

**Coming in Chapter Seven: "The Training"**

- Clyde's full origin revealed (how he escaped, why he chose Lumina)

- The training montage (teaching Lumina to kill cleanly, without
fallout)

- Polkin discovers what Clyde really is—and realizes he's not a threat,
he's family

- The Queen sends more Ghouls who recognize Clyde—but they're
terrified, not angry

- And Lumina learns the most important lesson: "Clean kills. No
collateral damage. That's how we survive."

---

**Author's Note: On Clean Kills and Radioactive Blood**

The Kaznak thermal/radiation mechanic solves a critical worldbuilding
problem:

**Why doesn't everyone just shoot the Ghouls?**

Because if you *wound* a Ghoul, its radioactive blood will kill you.

If you *explode* a Ghoul, its blood aerosolizes and kills everyone in
the area.

If you *cut* a Ghoul, you contaminate the entire zone for decades.

The only safe way to kill a Kaznak is **complete erasure**.

No blood. No remains. No fallout.

That's what makes Clyde's power so valuable: **he's the only one who
can kill them safely**.

And that's what makes him so dangerous to The Queen: **he can erase
her forces without creating martyrs or contamination zones**.

Clean kills. Professional execution. No collateral damage.

That's not just power.

That's *care*.
