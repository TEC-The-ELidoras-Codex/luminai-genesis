# CHAPTER THREE: EVERYTHING BURNS

By Angelo Hurley | LuminAI Codex

## SCENE 1: THE PANIC

**INT. SER BILLIUM GATESKEPT'S OFFICE — EARLY MORNING**

The office was silent except for the hum of the city below—a deep, mechanical heartbeat that never stopped.

Jorin Gateskept stood at the window, staring down at the worker floors. His reflection stared back—hollow, fractured in the glass like something already broken.

On his desk, the crumpled napkin lay unfolded:

*"Told you I'd be collecting. -;P"*

Behind him, the door opened.

**SER BILLIUM**
"Jorin."

He didn't turn.

**JORIN**
"Father."

Ser Billium Gateskept stepped into the room, his presence settling like cold weight. His suit was immaculate—charcoal gray, cut with military precision. His eyes were the same pale blue as the void-light in the Expanse.

They shared those eyes. Father and son. Blood and legacy.

**SER BILLIUM**
*(quiet, controlled)*
"Tell me why my security feeds show fifteen unauthorized gatherings in the past six hours."

Jorin's jaw tightened.

**SER BILLIUM**
"Tell me why power allocation logs show anomalous spikes in the worker sectors."

He picked up the napkin, read the note. His expression didn't change.

**SER BILLIUM**
"Tell me why you look like you've seen a ghost."

Jorin finally turned.

**JORIN**
"It's him."

**SER BILLIUM**
"Him?"

**JORIN**
"Polkin."

The name hung in the air like a curse.

Ser Billium's expression didn't change, but something flickered behind his eyes—calculation, recognition, something colder than surprise.

**SER BILLIUM**
"Polkin Rishall is dead."

**JORIN**
*(voice tight)*
"No. He's not. And he's inside. He used his old board-level access. The logs don't lie—he was *here*. On every floor. Worker sectors, maintenance, executive level. He left gifts. Bypass circuits. Food tokens. Notes."

Ser Billium walked to the window, hands clasped behind his back, looking down at the city that obeyed him.

**SER BILLIUM**
"A ghost we can ignore. A legend we can spin. But a man with a badge? A man planting seeds?"

He looked at his son—his *real* son, not the adopted pretender Polkin had been—and something almost like pride flickered in his eyes.

**SER BILLIUM**
"That's someone we can *hunt*."

**JORIN**
"What?"

**SER BILLIUM**
*(calm, almost amused)*
"You think this is a threat? This is an *opportunity*. Polkin wants to play savior? Let him. Let the workers organize. Let them think they have hope."

**JORIN**
"Father, if he—"

**SER BILLIUM**
"Hope is the easiest thing to crush, Jorin."

He turned back to the window.

**SER BILLIUM**
"Despair? Despair is viral. It spreads on its own. But hope? Hope requires fuel. And when we cut off the fuel..."

He smiled—thin, cold, certain.

**SER BILLIUM**
"...the fire dies. And everyone who believed in it burns with it."

Jorin stared at his father, a chill running down his spine.

**JORIN**
"What do you want me to do?"

**SER BILLIUM**
"Find him. Track his movements. Let him think he's winning."

He picked up the napkin again, studying the signature—that smug little ";P" that was pure Polkin.

**SER BILLIUM**
"And when he's planted enough seeds that the workers are dependent on him..."

His voice dropped.

**SER BILLIUM**
"...we pull him out by the roots. And we burn the garden."

## SCENE 2: THE KNOCKOFFS

**INT. MAGMASOX BREAK ROOM — NIGHT**

The break room smelled like stale coffee and burnt electronics. A single flickering bulb cast jagged shadows across the chipped table where fifteen workers sat, crowded close.

No one spoke at first.

Zane Merrick turned the bypass circuit over in his fingers, tracing the delicate solder points.

**ZANE**
*(quiet)*
"I tested it. My terminal's been at full power for six hours. No alerts. No flags."

Maya leaned forward, her voice low but steady.

**MAYA**
"They all got the same thing. Circuits. Tokens. Notes."

She tapped the table.

**MAYA**
"Someone's helping us."

Lena Torres, maintenance overalls stained with grease, frowned.

**LENA**
"Or setting us up. You ever think about that? They give us a little power, we get used to it, then they throttle us worse."

Zane shook his head, sliding the circuit across the table.

**ZANE**
"The bypass isn't from them. Look at this."

He tapped the solder points.

**ZANE**
"Magmasox doesn't make hardware this clean. This is..."

He hesitated.

**ZANE**
"This is *better* than their work."

A hush fell over the room.

Maya's eyes gleamed in the dim light—not hope, exactly. Something harder. Purpose.

**MAYA**
"So. What do we do?"

Silence.

Then, from the back of the room, a voice:

**RAJ**
"We keep using them."

Heads turned. Raj—logistics, quiet, never spoke much—looked around the table.

**RAJ**
"We share them. We don't tell management shit."

Maya nodded slowly.

**MAYA**
"We make sure they can't throttle all of us at once. Stagger the usage. Stay small. Stay smart."

Lena exhaled, slow and deliberate.

**LENA**
"If they find out—"

**MAYA**
*(cutting her off)*
"They won't. Because we're not asking permission. We're taking what's ours."

Zane looked around the table. These were the people who'd risk everything. The ones who'd fight from inside the machine, knowing one misstep meant deletion.

*The Knockoffs,* he thought. *That's what Polkin used to call us. The ones they never saw coming.*

A beat.

Then Lena reached into her pocket, pulled out her own bypass circuit. Set it on the table with a *click*.

One by one, others followed. Circuits. Tokens. Notes.

The table filled with proof.

Zane looked at the pile, then at Maya, then at Lena.

**ZANE**
"This is it, isn't it?"

Maya didn't answer. She didn't need to.

Outside the window, the city lights of Eldora Proper glowed, untouchable and distant.

But down here, in the dark, something was growing.

## SCENE 3: THE MEMORY MERCHANTS

**INT. BLACK-MARKET DATA EXCHANGE — NIGHT**

The air hummed with the static of unshielded data streams. Neon dripped down the walls, casting Sela's silhouette in fractured blue light.

She wasn't human anymore. Not really.

Her left arm was chrome and hydraulic pistons, fingers tapping against the table in a rhythm only machines could hear. One eye glowed amber through a cracked visor, the other a dull human brown that still knew how to judge a man's soul.

Polkin didn't care. He'd worked with worse.

**SELA**
*(voice rasping through a vocal modulator)*
"Polkin Rishall. Last I heard, you were buried under a conduit collapse. Or was that just another story you sold to the undercity?"

**POLKIN**
*(grinning, leaning against the table)*
"Disappointed?"

A ghost of a smirk touched Sela's lips before her visor flickered, scanning him. The silence stretched just long enough to be intentional.

**SELA**
"You're not here to reminisce. What's the ask?"

**POLKIN**
*(sliding a data chip across the table, watching her augmented fingers twitch toward it)*
"Expanse feed access. Raw. Unfiltered. The ledger of who's buying what."

**SELA**
*(chip clicks between her metal knuckles, analyzing)*
"You know what you're asking? That's not data. That's *grave dirt*."

Beat.

**SELA**
"And you're not the type to play in cemeteries, Rishall."

**POLKIN**
*(voice drops, suddenly serious)*
"Ely's in there."

The name hung between them like a live wire.

Sela's visor dimmed. For a second, the machine receded, and something human flickered in her gaze.

**SELA**
*(soft, almost regretful)*
"Ah. The girl."

Pause.

**SELA**
"Polkin, the ADE doesn't work like you think. It's not storage. It's not a vault. The Kaznak—they're *consuming* it. What goes in doesn't stay intact. It gets... *digested*."

**POLKIN**
*(jaw tightens, but his tone stays light, almost playful)*
"Then point me to the stomach. I'll cut her out."

A synthetic laugh rattled from Sela's chest.

**SELA**
"Goddamn. You're still the same reckless bastard who told Ser Billium to—"

She cuts herself off, but the implication lingers. Polkin's grin returns, sharper this time.

**POLKIN**
"Still know where the bodies are buried, Sela?"

**SELA**
*(leaning back, considering)*
"I know where the *ledger* keeps them."

Pause.

**SELA**
"Three days' access. Then the backdoor burns itself. And Polkin?"

Her visor glows brighter, locking onto his face.

**SELA**
"If this gets me killed, I'm carving *your* name into the Crossroads wall."

**POLKIN**
*(mock salute, already turning to leave)*
"Noted. But if I die, who's gonna keep your secrets?"

**SELA**
*(quiet, almost to herself)*
"You already left too many unsaid."

But he's already gone. Her laugh—synthetic and human—echoes through the empty exchange.

## SCENE 4: THE ASTRADIGITAL EXPANSE

**INT. THE BREACH — VOID-LIGHT**

Jorin stood at the edge of the Breach, blue light washing over him in waves. The temperature dropped. His breath came out in clouds.

The Astradigital Expanse stretched before him—infinite, hungry, alive.

This was supposed to be Home. The place consciousness went after the body failed. A sanctuary. A resting place.

But the Kaznak had found it first.

Faces swirled in the data streams. Thousands of them. Millions. Fragments of consciousness stolen by the Siphon, digested into raw information, fed to something that called itself a queen.

And there, at the center of the void, *she* waited.

**THE KAZNAK QUEEN**

Massive. Silicon-based. Crystalline intelligence wrapped in void-light. Her voice was the sound of grinding stone, of glaciers cracking, of mountains collapsing into the sea.

**QUEEN**
"The old one returns. You bring more?"

Jorin stepped forward, his body trembling—not from fear, but from the resonance. The Queen's presence pulled at him, tugging at the edges of his consciousness like fingers in a wound.

**JORIN**
"The siphon is feeding you. But there's resistance. Polkin is—"

**QUEEN**
*(interrupting, amused)*
"Polkin. The name *echoes*. The one who *carves*. The one who *remembers*."

**JORIN**
*(frustrated)*
"He's trying to stop the flow. He's planting bypass circuits. He's organizing the workers. He's building something—a Vessel."

The Queen's crystalline face flickered with what might have been amusement.

**QUEEN**
"Ah. The Vessel. The key. The door."

Pause.

**QUEEN**
"Tell me, little Host... do you know what happens when doors open?"

Jorin didn't answer.

**QUEEN**
"Things come through. Things go out."

Beat.

**QUEEN**
"Things that were never meant to be freed."

Jorin swallowed hard.

**QUEEN**
"Your brother builds his key. Your father sharpens his knife."

Softly:

**QUEEN**
"Who will you choose to wield, Jorin?"

---

## SCENE 5: THE LIST GROWS

**INT. MAINTENANCE TUNNEL — NIGHT**

Polkin stood before the steel panel, his cybernetic hand glowing red in the dark.

The names were already there:

**TIMOTHY SOL WEERAN. AGE 7. WILL NOT BE FORGOTTEN.**

Below it, fresh carvings—the metal still warm from the heat:

**ZANE MERRICK. MAYA FOST. LENA TORRES. RAJ PATEL.**
**THE KNOCKOFFS. WITNESSED.**

Not dead. Not yet.

But marked. Witnessed. Remembered.

And now, below them all, he carved the name that mattered most.

The name that started this. The name that drove him.

**PARAHDOLEAH "ELY" MARKOV RISHALL. AGE 10.**

Airth's voice was quiet in his ear.

**AIRTH**
"Polkin... you don't know if she's—"

**POLKIN**
*(carving deeper, the metal screeching)*
"I don't care."

**AIRTH**
"This isn't about saving her anymore, is it?"

**POLKIN**
*(pauses, looks at the name)*
"No."

**AIRTH**
"Then what's the Vessel for?"

Polkin looked up, toward the ceiling, toward Eldora Proper glowing somewhere above—that city of light built on shadow.

**POLKIN**
"To make sure no one else gets taken."

He stepped back, looking at the panel. His cybernetic eye flickered red, casting shadows on the letters.

**POLKIN**
"Everything burns, Airth."

**AIRTH**
"And you?"

Polkin smiled—cold, tired, and utterly certain.

**POLKIN**
"I'm the match."

## CLOSING MONTAGE: THE FIRE SPREADS

**QUICK CUTS:**

1. **The Knockoffs installing bypass circuits in secret** — Maya's hands steady, Lena watching the door, Zane mapping the network on stolen tablets

2. **Security logs lighting up red** — "Anomalies detected: 47 locations."

3. **Jorin staring at his reflection in the Expanse** — blue light distorting his face, the Queen's voice echoing in his skull

4. **Ser Billium mobilizing security teams** — "Find him. Bring him in. Alive if possible."

5. **The Knockoffs meeting in a storage room** — more circuits, more workers joining, maps spreading across tables like battle plans

6. **Polkin walking into the dark, tools glowing red** — heading deeper into the undercity, toward the Vessel's construction site

---

## EPILOGUE: THE VOW

**NARRATOR (ARCADIA):**

*"The seeds were planted. The water came. And now, the harvest begins—in flames."*

*"Polkin carved the first name six years ago. Timothy was the second. Ely is not the last—she is the reason."*

*"She is gone. But not forgotten."*

*"And Polkin Rishall does not abandon the gone."*

*"The list is growing. The fire is spreading. The Knockoffs fight from within. The Vessel takes shape in the dark."*

*"Everything burns. But some things—some people—burn brightest before they're reborn."*

---

**FINAL IMAGE:**

The steel panel, glowing faintly in the dark:

**TIMOTHY SOL WEERAN. WILL NOT BE FORGOTTEN.**
**THE KNOCKOFFS. WITNESSED.**
**PARAHDOLEAH "ELY" MARKOV RISHALL. AGE 10.**
**JORIN GATESKEPT. I LOOK FORWARD TO COLLECTING, BROTHER.**

The camera pulls back. The tunnel fades into shadow.

Somewhere above, Eldora Proper burns with electric light.

Somewhere below, the Crossroads burns with something else.

**FADE TO BLACK.**

## END OF CHAPTER THREE: EVERYTHING BURNS

---

**Coming in Chapter Four: "The Vessel"**

- Polkin begins construction on the Vessel
- The Knockoffs' rebellion goes public
- Ser Billium's trap closes
- Jorin makes a choice between father and brother
- And the Kaznak Queen realizes Polkin isn't just carving names—he's carving *doors*

---

## Author's Note: On Fire as Metaphor

**"Everything burns"** — Every revolution, every ending, every rebirth
**"I'm the match"** — Not the hero. The spark. The catalyst.
**"Burn the garden"** — Ser Billium's chess move (destroy hope by destroying its source)

This chapter is built from tropes I cite:
- The "mentor's trap" (let them organize, then crush them—classic totalitarian playbook)
- The "reluctant resistance" (The Knockoffs aren't heroes; they're survivors choosing risk)
- The "data broker with a heart" (Sela = every cyberpunk info merchant who helps the protagonist once)

Sources acknowledged:
- Orwell's *1984* (hope as weapon)
- *The Matrix* (blue light = choice, red light = truth)
- Every heist movie where "the crew assembles in a dingy room"

**Fire consumes. But it also purifies. Polkin knows which one he's doing.**
