# CHAPTER TWO: THE CLEAN BREAK

By Angelo Hurley | LuminAI Codex

## OPENING: BOARDROOM GHOST

The hum of Magmasox HQ pulsed like a bruise, deep and throbbing. Polkin's cybernetic eye flickered with it, a rhythmic reminder of the heart he'd sold to this place. The scent of polished steel and antiseptic clung to the air, but beneath it, he caught the ghost of burnt wiring—the smell of the Crossroads, of home.

He ignored the alarms. Had no need for them.

His board-level badge—etched in his grandfather's antique font—still commanded obedience. Doors clicked open at his approach: vaulted executive suites, shadowed maintenance tunnels, dim worker corridors. Each lock yielded to his legacy, his buried complicity.

Airth's voice crackled in his ear, laced with doubt:

**AIRTH**  
"You know this is madness, right? Stalking through the beast you helped create?"

Polkin stayed silent, shoving the mop cart ahead, eyes scanning sterile floors, glowing monitors, patrolling drones. But inside, the grief clawed—

Ely's voice echoing in his auditory implant, a ghost loop from six years ago: *Daddy, I love you.*

The same ache that had hollowed him when the call came, five planets away, silence on the line where her laughter should have been.

**POLKIN**  
*(whispers, half to himself)*  
"Seeds."

His cybernetic fingers twitched as if carving her name anew.

**AIRTH**  
"Seeds for what?"

He halted, his cybernetic eye flaring faintly.

**POLKIN**  
"Something Grandfather always said. 'Seeding the pond.'"

Airth paused, then deadpanned:

**AIRTH**  
"You're not seeding, Polkin. You're baiting a revolution."

Polkin's mouth twitched.

**POLKIN**  
"Maybe."

## WORKER FLOORS: SILENT SALVATION

The air reeked of scorched circuits and quiet despair. Desks crammed together, cubicles shrouded in gloom.

Polkin glided like a shadow, depositing gifts at each station:

- A concealed bypass circuit—restoring stolen power, invisible to scans, a whisper of defiance
- A solid food token—real credits for real sustenance, not synthetic sludge
- A scrawled note: **"NOT FORGOTTEN. -P"**

His hands moved with the precision of a man who'd spent a decade locking doors. But his breath hitched when he placed the last note, fingers lingering on the paper. *NOT FORGOTTEN.* As if two words could undo the years of silence.

With each drop, the weight pressed harder:

Timothy's small body in his arms, fading warmth seeping through his coat, the boy's shy wave replaying like a glitch. *Bye, mister.*

Polkin's knuckles whitened, micro-welds groaning—the same hands that had punched conduit walls until they bled, raging against a system that deemed kids non-essential.

Ely's death had started it. Timothy's had etched it deeper—a vow in blood and steel.

Behind him, logs flickered unseen. Maya spotted it first: doors unlocking without overrides, systems bending to a phantom badge.

Her instincts flared—survival, not sentiment. This was authority Polkin had never surrendered.

Elara might have clashed with her here, two unbreakable forces colliding from opposite sides. But tonight, their orbits spared them.

As Polkin wove through the floors, flickering lights and whining circuits composed a dirge of decay. Ozone stung the air, laced with the metallic bite of regret on his tongue. Each step echoed the lives crushed by his old designs, the Throttle that had plunged so many into shadow—

Shadows where Ely's memory flickered, fragile as a dying node.

## MORNING SHIFT: THE DISCOVERY

Dawn brought a hushed buzz to the worker floors.

Zane Merrick slumped into his cubicle, terminal grinding to life. Eight weeks at 8% power. Coffee bitter and cold. Eyes sunken.

Beneath his keyboard, a silver disk gleamed.

Hands trembling, he examined it: a power bypass.

A token dangled from his monitor. Notes dotted the floor: **"NOT FORGOTTEN. -P"**

Zane's hands shook as he slotted the bypass into his terminal. The screen flickered to life, banishing the gloom. His daughter's face appeared in a frozen video call—her birthday, last year.

He swallowed hard.

Someone had seen them. Someone had cared.

Across the floor, Maya watched from afar as whispers spread, circuits traded, hope kindled. No manifestos. No calls to arms. Just tangible proof of visibility.

Polkin remained unseen, but his trace lingered in the logs:

**"ACCESS GRANTED: POLKIN RISHALL — ALL FLOORS"**

Security terminals flashed in alarm:

**"Who retains this access? He's vanished... dead? Or deranged?"**

The badge that forged the Throttle now unraveled it. The irony seared—like the soldering iron Polkin had used to carve Timothy's name, heat blurring his vision through unshed tears.

Maya's gaze sharpened on the feeds, tracing the deliberate chaos. Seeds sown, system sluggish to respond.

Admiration flickered, swiftly quashed. Survival first.

## EXECUTIVE FLOOR: JORIN'S OFFICE

Glass walls mirrored his dominion of control.

Jorin Gateskept arrived early, already weary. He sensed it immediately:

A Bento box, steaming fresh. Truffle mac & cheese.

He left it untouched, eyes dropping to the worker levels below. A subtle shift—a murmur of unrest.

**JORIN**  
"Seal the building. Now."

Security faltered:

**SECURITY**  
"Sir... no intrusion logged. Floors scrubbed, air systems refreshed. Workers... aligned."

He eyed the Bento box again.

Inside, a napkin:

**"Told you I'd be collecting. -;P"**

Jorin stared at the note, the steam curling into the shape of a question. Polkin had been *here*. In his office. Breathing his air.

The note wasn't just ink on paper. It was a knife twist: *I know where you sleep.*

His fingers dug into the armrests, the synthetic leather groaning. The note wasn't just a taunt. It was a promise. Polkin wasn't just inside the building.

He was inside Jorin's head, carving names into his certainty.

Flickering lights stretched shadows across the room, turning the box into a mocking glow. Jorin's reflection stared back—hollow, fractured.

## THE ROOFTOP: SEEDS PLANTED

The rain had ceased.

Polkin balanced on a ledge across from HQ. Below, fifteen souls clustered in a break room, poring over circuits and tokens, murmuring possibility.

Airth's tone was wry:

**AIRTH**  
"So, we infiltrated the monster hunting you. Scrubbed floors. Delivered lunch. What's next?"

Polkin smiled thinly, but it didn't reach his eyes—eyes haunted by Ely's final silence, by Timothy's limp form.

He watched the workers below, their huddled forms illuminated by the glow of reclaimed power. His chest ached.

He'd built the Throttle. He'd signed the orders. And now he was tearing it down, one circuit at a time.

But redemption wasn't a ledger he could balance. Not with Ely's silence screaming in his skull.

**POLKIN**  
"We wait for ripples in the pond."

He melted into the night. The spark of rebellion ignited.

City lights glittered below, stark against the undercity's void. Polkin glimpsed the worker floors' faint pulse, a spark in the gloom.

Seeds embedded. Now, for the storm.

Polkin traced Timothy's name on his wrist display, the letters glowing like embers.

The list was longer now. The storm was coming.

And for the first time in years, he wasn't running from it.

He was the lightning.

---

## EPILOGUE: THE LIST CONTINUES

Polkin's red eye pulsed.

The initial names, etched in steel, stood as vows—each stroke a penance, his cybernetic hand trembling as if reliving the carve:

**TIMOTHY SOL WEERAN**  
Age seven, monster drawings clutched in small fists, "bye mister" echoing like an accusation Polkin couldn't delete.

**ZANE MERRICK**  
**MAYA FOST**  
**Others to follow**

He wielded the access. The insight. And, for the first time post-Throttle, redemption beckoned—

But it tasted like ash, mingled with Ely's absent voice, the silence where her "I love you" should loop forever.

The ledger stretched long.

The reaping had only dawned.

**FADE TO BLACK.**

## Author's Note: On Knockoffs and Sources

**"Seeding the pond"** — My grandfather's phrase, reimagined  
**"Murder hobo"** — D&D slang, repurposed for a grief-driven saboteur  
**"NOT FORGOTTEN"** — Every punk song, every protest chant, every name carved in concrete

This chapter is built from tropes I love and cite:
- The "ghost in the machine" infiltrator (cyberpunk classic)
- The "one good deed" domino effect (It's a Wonderful Life meets Fight Club)
- The "corporate villain gets a lunch delivery" twist (because fuck their Bento boxes)

I'm not hiding my sources. I'm acknowledging the lineage while carving my own name into it.

That's what storytelling is: the same narrative devices, ingested and repurposed.

I'm just the one who calls out my sources as I'm doing it.

**It's not stealing. It's awareness of who I heard the similar tropes from.**
